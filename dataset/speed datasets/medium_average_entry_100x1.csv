"Well, that makes things a bit easier though. Firstly, check if you have android-tools-adb and android-tools-fastboot installed. The way to check this is obviously depends on your package manager, in case of debian derivatives with apt-get as Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot. Then connect your device to computer after getting in recovery. From that point you can use some diagnosis tools with adb/fastboot. Anyway, firstly you should try to clear cache as I mentioned before.",0

"<p>Another way of showing there is no countable basis is by proving that the space $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ has a quotient which does not admit a countable basis. This is in fact the hyperreals ${}^\ast\mathbb{R}$. By the saturation property, given any (countable) sequence of nonzero hyperreals, one can find an infinitesimal which is incomparably smaller than all of the hyperreals in the sequence. This shows that there is no countable basis (but of course does not quite give $2^{\aleph_0}$ without CH).</p>

"<p>The only ""danger"" I've ever encountered is the voice-coil permanent magnets.  If you were to pinch some flesh between them you could end up with a minor but painful hematoma or laceration.  When separated by a small distance (3-4mm) they can exert several kilograms of force, which increases quadratically as they get closer together.  If you let them stick together it will require significant force and a wedge of some kind to separate them.</p>

"<p>Yes, gravitational waves can be shielded. As gravitons are the particles which can interact with matter, the matter can absorb gravitons. </p>

<p>This would depend on the wavelength however. For uniform substance the rate of absorption would generally decrease with the wavelength. The rate of absorption also can be increased by constructing mechanical oscillators with frequency in resonance with that of gravitational waves. Such oscillators would transform gravitational waves into mechanical energy.</p>
