While I've been at the iAWACS and EICAR conferences with somewhat erratic connectivity, it seems that Matousec have discovered The End of Antivirus As We Know It. Actually, a lot of people have been doing that this week, but that's a topic for a later blog. Fortunately, while I was trying to get a connection for long enough to comment without making sarcastic remarks about Matousec's web page and the invitation to flirt with nubile young ladies, Juraj Malcho, our Head of Lab in Bratislava, put something together for us.

Sometimes catchy headlines make news even if there’s absolutely no news. I guess they usually call it marketing. Or hype. Like here.

There’s been a great amount of discussion about the recent article from Matousec at http://www.matousec.com/info/articles/khobe-8.0-earthquake-for-windows-desktop-security-software.php. So what’s the 8.0 earthquake problem? What did they really find out? Not much new really.

First of all, Matousec researchers are obviously unaware of previous works and terminology. What we have here is a specific example of TOCTTOU (time-of-check-to-time-of-use) attack – see http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/bishop/papers/1996-compsys/racecond.pdf or http://www.watson.org/~robert/2007woot/2007usenixwoot-exploitingconcurrency.pdf. But for an even better example, see http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2003/Dec/351, which pretty much describes the same thing as this innovative Matousec research.

Anyway, there is a vulnerability. And what is vulnerable is our SelfDefense module, which, speaking non-techie language, under certain circumstances could probably be bypassed, thus allowing software (malware) which would otherwise be blocked to perform some activities. What does that mean to our users? If your machine were to be infected by such hypothetical malware, there's a possibility that the scanner wouldn't see it. This has a number of implications:

Our standard scanner protecting your PC is not affected by this. Should Khobe attack be performed on your PC, it has been infected already – so, this vulnerability is trying to compromise a PC that has already been compromised. The Khobe attack can, effectively, be used (not altogether reliably) to cloak malware already running on the system. This ‘uncertainty cloaking’ is far from what is being seen as a significant trend in current modern professional malware – if you want to stay under the radar, you’re not taking chances. There are other ways to implement self concealment from antivirus (rootkits, in particular) – irrespective of whether we’re talking about massive attacks, or targeted ones. This method has not been seen in the wild until today. As we can see, a similar (or pretty much the same) PoC was published almost over 6 years ago. Over the time, no malware misused this.

As already mentioned, the vulnerability is there, but its magnitude is more of a pin dropping on the floor than an 8.0 earthquake, when it comes to its impact on the overall security of our customers’ PCs. However, we are looking into this to see how we can prevent these attacks in case we start to see them being misused.

To which I can only add, as I did to the press yesterday, that to suggest that ""today's most popular security solutions simply do not work"" on the strength of a long-known race condition issue in the operating is more than a little overstated.

"Thousands of Facebook addicts are feverishly sharing a “news report” claiming that from November 1st you’ll be paying $2.99 every month to access the site.

Will Facebook start charging you to access the world’s most popular social network?

Of course not.

But that isn’t stopping thousands of Facebook addicts from feverishly sharing a link to what they believe is a news report claiming that from November 1st you’ll be paying $2.99 every month.

If you click through on the link you will be taken to a satirical news website, not a legitimate news outlet, which has a phoney news report claiming that Facebook will soon be charging its billion users for access.

It’s nonsense of course. If it were in anyway true, you would expect to see an announcement on Facebook’s official blog, or in the headlines of major online news outlets.

Instead, the only site that appears to be reporting this “breaking news” is an outlet called nationalreport.net:

The bogus report starts sanely enough, and might have fooled some people into believing it was true:

Menlo Park, CA — At a press conference this morning, Facebook rolled out their new monthly service plan which begins November 1st of this year. The social media giant says they will start charging members $2.99/mo to use the services that the site has to offer.

“After thinking long and hard about this decision, at the end of the day, we were forced to add this monthly fee,” Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg told reporters. “If we don’t do something about our rising costs now, Facebook could cease to exist in the near future.” “This is excellent news for Facebook stock holders,” says Wall Street analyst Dale Sackrider. “As of August this year, Facebook had a total of 1.317 billion users. If just 75% of those members pay the new monthly service fee of $3, that will mean an annual influx of cash totaling roughly $3 billion. That’s not just an increase in profits of a few dollars, that’s a game changer right there.”

As you read on, however, you should have begun to question whether the report should be taken at face value:

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian anti-masturbation group, says their business could not survive without Facebook. “Charging people to use Facebook means there won’t be as many heathens on the site to help stay off the Devil’s playground. Personally, I like Facebook because it helps me promote my side business of making personalized video greetings. Those videos are good, clean fun for the whole family, and they also help pay for my anger management and sex offender classes. Praise Fappy!”

It’s not exactly what I would describe as amusing satire, but I suspect that wasn’t the true intention of the nationalreport.net website. Instead, my guess is that they knew the story would be shared by unthinking Facebook users, driving traffic to the webpage and helping them earn money through online advertising.

It’s a dirty trick, but it’s been done before – and it will happen again and again until internet users wise up and think before they share a link.

The truth is that Facebook doesn’t need to charge you. It makes more than enough money from advertisers, without needing to charge its 1,000,000,000+ users.

Indeed, forcing Facebook to pay a subscription would likely ruin its business model, as many users would revolt and go elsewhere.

Mind you, maybe charging $2.99 per month isn’t a completely daft move. I, for one, would feel much more willing to pay Facebook a small amount of money if I felt that it would mean my personal data wasn’t being monetised by Facebook, and if my being a paying customer meant that the site listened to my point of view when it came to security and privacy.

Hmm. Don’t hold your breath…",1
"Security researchers found a vulnerability in Android that could allow attackers to steal information from smartphones through remotely executed code via a crafted MMS. According to them up to 950 million devices could be vulnerable.

Updated 3rd April, 2016: Independent security analyst Graham Cluley reported in February that Google had released its latest security update for Nexus devices running Android, adding that one of the most serious flaws found could result in remote code execution: “For instance, the bug in Mediaserver could mean that simply opening an email, browsing a website or receiving a media file via MMS could [result in] malicious code being run on your device. If this sounds familiar then chances are you remember Stagefright, one of the biggest Android security scares of last year.”

Updated October 5th: It has been reported that Google, in partnership with manufacturers and carriers, will release a patch today to resolve newly identified vulnerabilities, after Zimperium Lab revealed last week that a sequel to Stagefright had been found. The bug could now compromise as many as a billion Android users.

In a blog, Zimperium Lab stated: “The first vulnerability (in libutils) impacts almost every Android device since version 1.0 released in 2008. We found methods to trigger that vulnerability in devices running version 5.0 and up using the second vulnerability (in libstagefright). Google assigned CVE-2015-6602 to vulnerability in libutils. We plan to share CVE information for the second vulnerability as soon as it is available.”

Updated September 10th: An exploit is made available by Zimperium Labs for testing purposes. The python script creates an MP4 that exploits the CVE-2015-1538 vulnerability, one of the most critical flaws of Stagefright. However, according to the author, this isn’t a generic exploit as it has only been tested on one device: Nexus running Android 4.0.4.



Updated August 18th: In order to make it even more easier for you to detect whether your Android device is vulnerable or not to Stagefright, we have launched an app that you can download directly from Google Play. Although no new announcements have been provided by Google to confirm when a new patch will be rolled out, it is anticipated that this will take place in September.

Also, it is worth noting Trend Micro published an article on 17th August about a MediaServer flaw, another vulnerability in Android that does not presently appear to be related to Stagefright. However, this has since been fixed by Google via its Android Open Source Project (AOSP).



One week before Black Hat and DEF CON, security researcher Joshua Drake published his findings about a vulnerability in the heart of Android that could allow attackers to steal information from Android devices through remotely executed code via a maliciously crafted MMS. According to the Zimperium zLabs researcher, up to 950 million devices could be vulnerable.

Since this was dubbed one of the biggest vulnerabilities ever, we’re summing up a quick FAQ about it in order to better understand this vulnerability, as well as highlight how you can find out if your Android device is vulnerable.

Is it really the worst of all Android vulnerabilities?

It is difficult to label a vulnerability as being the worst, because the basis for this attribution varies.For instance, factors including the number of devices affected, ease of compromising and the number of exploits in the wild, all of these have varying influences on the severity of a vulnerability. However, with 950 million users of Android devices potentially affected and after one failed attempted by Google to fix it, we should take this a bit more seriously than other, more commonplace vulnerabilities.

How does this vulnerability work and why is it called Stagefright?",1
"Most people now use a wi-fi network to access the internet around the home. However an unsecured network could let your neighbor’s piggyback on your broadband or worse, let hackers snoop on your activities. Luckily it’s not that difficult to harden the security of your home network. Here’s a quick step-by-step. 1 Check the router

Most people now use a wi-fi network to access the internet around the home. However an unsecured network could let your neighbor’s piggyback on your broadband or worse, let hackers snoop on your activities. Luckily it’s not that difficult to harden the security of your home network. Here’s a quick step-by-step.

1 Check the router settings

The first thing to do is open a web browser to gain access to the inner workings of your router. Every router will have its own IP address (a series of numbers like 192.168.1.1) which will take you to the router management program. The manual for the router or your broadband provider should be able to supply the right address Simply type the relevant number (with the dots) into the address field of your browser to open the router settings.

2 Set an admin user name and password

You should now see the router settings in the browser window. If it does not ask you for a user name and password this means you have never been here before. Now is the time to set these up to prevent unauthorized access to your router settings. You should find this under the heading of “user management” or similar. If the name of your network and password are still the factory defaults now is the time to change them as would-be hackers can easily look up default settings of most routers just using Google.

3 Make you router invisible by changing and hiding the SSID

The SSID (Service Center Identifier) is just a fancy technical term for the name of your own wireless network. It is what appears in the list of available networks that devices display when people are looking to join a network. By going into the SSID setting you can make your network “invisible” to anyone outside your network by disabling the “SSID broadcasting” function. Users will have to know and enter the Network Name manually if they want to connect to your wireless network. You should also rename your network from the factory default (Verizon, AT&T or similar) to something so that only authorized users will know. Don’t use your name, address or anything else that would be obvious.

4 Enable Network Encryption

You’ve made your network invisible to the outside world but you now need to scramble all the data going in and out of it to further deter hackers and snoopers. This is known as encryption and your router will have settings to allow you to do this. You will see the options for the following settings: WEP, WPA & WPA2. WEP is the least secure and WPA2 is the most advanced, unless you have older devices that require WEP, go WPA2 for as it is much harder to crack. You now need to set a password to enter your newly encrypted Wi-Fi network. Choose something long, with a mix of characters that cannot easily be guessed by a hacker.

5 Add MAC addresses

These are nothing to do with Apple computers but instead the unique code hard coded into any network device. To further secure your network you can add the MAC addresses of all authorized devices in the home – iPhones, tablets, laptops etc. – to the router’s authorized list. No other device will then be allowed on the network. You can find the MAC addresses of mobile phones and other portable devices under their network settings, though this will vary for each device. Check with the manufacturer.

Having done all this, your Wi-Fi network should now considerably more secure than it was before. If you get stuck, contact your broadband provider directly as they should be able to provide assistance.",1
" Technical trade secrets were stolen from the steel production and manufacturing plant design divisions of ThyssenKrupp AG ( ) in cyber attacks earlier this year, the German company  said on Thursday. ThyssenKrupp, one of the world’s largest steel makers, said it had been targeted by attackers located in southeast Asia engaged in what it said were ”organized, highly professional hacker activities”. In breaches discovered by the company’s internal security team in April and traced back to February, hackers stole project data from ThyssenKrupp’s plant engineering division and from other areas yet to be determined. ”ThyssenKrupp has become the target of a massive cyber attack,” the industrial conglomerate said in a statement. Globally, cyber attacks on banks, retailers and other businesses have led to widespread consumer and financial data losses in recent years. ThyssenKrupp’s disclosure followed last week’s attack on Deutsche Telekom routers that caused outage for nearly 1 million customers. While revelations of industrial espionage are far rarer, estimates put the costs to businesses in the billions of dollars. China was frequently blamed for such commercial hacking attacks until the United States and China agreed not to hack each other’s businesses ( ).  German business magazine Wirtschafts Woche reported the attacks hit sites in Europe, India, Argentina and the United States run by the Industrial Solutions division, which builds large production plants. The Hagen Hohenlimburg specialty steel mill in western Germany was also targeted, the report added. The company declined to identify specific locations which were infected or speculate on likely suspects. It said it could not estimate the scale of the intellectual property losses. BIG BANG   ThyssenKrupp said it waited to publicize the attack while it identified, then cleansed infected systems in one concerted, global action before implementing new safeguards to monitor its computer systems. ”It is important not to let the intruder know that he has been discovered,” a spokesman said. A criminal complaint was filed with police in the state of North   and an investigation is ongoing, it said. State and federal cyber security and data protection authorities were kept informed at each stage, as well as Thyssen’s board.  Secured systems operating steel blast furnaces and power plants in Duisburg, in Germany’s industrial heartland in the Ruhr Valley, were unaffected, the company said.  No breaches were found at its marine systems unit, which produces military submarines and warships. A previous cyber attack caused physical damage to an unidentified German steel plant and prevented the mill’s blast furnace from shutting down properly.  The country’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) revealed two years ago that the attack caused ”massive damage” but gave no further technical details and the location of the plant has remained shrouded in mystery.  Subsequent media reports identified the target as a ThyssenKrupp facility, but the company has denied it was hit. The industrial conglomerate, along with Airbus parent EADS, were the targets of major attacks by Chinese hackers in 2012, according to a Der Spiegel report ( ). The company, a big supplier of steel to Germany’s automotive sector and other manufacturers, is looking to form a joint venture of its European steel operations with India’s Tata Steel ( ) to combat   in the sector.  (Editing by Jason   Weir) HELSINKI Telecoms network equipment maker Nokia and Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Technology have signed a patent licensing agreement, the companies said on Wednesday. SAO PAULO Financial technology firms in Brazil are targeting lending to   and   companies to fill a gap in the credit market left by large lenders deterred by rising delinquencies and narrow margins.

"Over the last few weeks we’ve seen an increase in fake vouchers being spread via WhatsApp. This scam has all the hallmarks of a global campaign.

Over the last few weeks we’ve seen an increase in fake vouchers – purporting to be from different shops – being spread throughout the world via WhatsApp. This is not the first time that we have seen users receive these kinds of vouchers but, on analysis of this recent flurry of activity, we can be almost certain that, this time, we are talking about an organized scam campaign that is operating on a global scale.

First examples

It was mid-August when we first observed that people were receiving links sent by their WhatsApp contacts that pointed to some kind of survey that was sponsored by a well-known supermarket brand from numerous countries. Below you can see two examples of this scam, one for Coles Supermarket (Australia) and another for Mercadona (Spain).

Thanks to the guys at Hispasec, we now know that these examples were not isolated cases and that the individuals behind the scams were effective in impersonating these brands (and gain the confidence of users). Some of the supermarkets used to this effect included Lidl in Italy, 7-Eleven in the US, Albert Heijn in the Netherlands and Woolworths in Australia.

The way in which the scam works is relatively simple. Some WhatsApp users receive a message with a link that redirects them to a fake website that is mimicking the supermarket in question, promising then voucher of a certain worth. To benefit from this deal, the user needs to register their personal data, including their name, email, mobile phone number, address and so forth.

All this data is then collected and subsequently used in spam campaigns. However, in addition to this, it’s also possible that the scammers will try and lure the victim into subscribing to a premium SMS service that will cost him or her money.

Other variants

It seems that this initial campaign was quite profitable for the scammers because, since then, we have seen similar cases materialize (at least a new one every week). For example, last week we observed a new scam campaign using the same strategy but this time claiming to be Starbucks. Of course, the vouchers were adapted to the local currency.

In this case, the scammers didn’t bother themselves in translating the message for other non-English speaking countries. Even then, people filled in the fields that requested their personal data.

Just yesterday, Pablo Ramos, head of LATAM research lab at ESET, analyzed another campaign that was impersonating the Spanish fashion firm Zara.

In this instance, the scammers weren’t looking for personal data. Instead, they were trying to convince the victim that their Android device was infected and needed urgent attention. They would then aim to lure them to download a fake antivirus app by subscribing to a SMS premium service.

Conclusion

These new scam campaigns adapt and reuse other techniques that we have seen in recent years when analyzing mobile focused malware. The use of a recognizable brand to convince the victim of authenticity, the false voucher promising an interesting prize – these are examples of strategies that have been previously deployed. But what makes these new campaigns dangerous is how fast they are spreading through instant messaging apps like WhatsApp.

It reminds us of a time when Microsoft Messenger was used to share links that would redirect users to a malicious website, and, as these recent cases have proven, if it has worked before, then it can work again. It’s our job as security conscious individuals to make sure that we people won’t fall into this trap and not only avoid clicking onto these links but also warning our contact to do the same.",1
"Half of the world’s 50 biggest banks have faced security incidents affecting their web applications. Fifteen per cent of those incidents were classified as “high” or “critical” risks, a new study has revealed.

Half of the 50 biggest banks have faced security incidents affecting their web applications. Fifteen per cent of those incidents were classified as “high” or “critical” risks, a new study has revealed.

The research was carried out by Swiss IT services firm High-Tech Bridge, and found that 11 bank sites had faced serious incidents in the past eight years, according to Computer World.

High-Tech Bridge claim that research by Frost and Sullivan shows that three out of four network intrusions are the result of insecure web applications. The company acknowledges that its data does not include information on DDoS attacks or phishing – threats commonly faced by banks.

The Swiss firm published its research, based on publicly available data, to coincide with a “cyber war game” testing the defenses of Britain’s investment banks. The firm was involved in testing security for some of these institutions, according to CEO Ilia Kolochenko, interviewed by the London Evening Standard.

Most bank sites had faced low- or medium-risk incidents involving their web applications, usually involving cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

Ilia Kolochenko, High-Tech Bridge CEO, says: “The numbers we see are quite impressive, even though our research only covered publicly-known security incidents and we didn’t take into account the more common DDoS attacks or phishing campaigns as they do not involve security of web application directly.

“The statistics confirm that even financial institutions should pay more attention to their web application security, not only to protect their customers but to maintain their digital reputation. The fact that there are few security incidents publicly exposed in 2013 does not necessarily confirm that web applications are becoming more secure. It’s more about new objectives of hackers – today they are not looking for glory but for profit, therefore don’t make any noise and compromise web systems without being noticed.”

A ‘war game’ scenario on Tuesday, reported by We Live Security tested thousands of banking staff across London’s investment banks against the ‘worst case scenario’ – a major cyber attack on stock exchanges, among other scenarios.The simulation – ‘Waking Shark II’ is one of the largest exercises of its kind ever organized in the world, according to a report by Reuters. The exercise also simulated other scenarios, such as how banks ensure the availability of cash from ATM machines.

The “game” was organized by the Bank of England, the Treasury and Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority and follows a similar exercise two years ago.

In September, Scott Borg, chief of the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit, said that he believed manipulation of the financial markets would be the next major target for cybercriminals, according to Computer World.

More than half of securities exchanges around the world faced cyber attacks last year, according to a paper released by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), according to an earlier We Live Security report.



“The number of high profile and critical ‘hits’ is also increasing,” says the IOSCO report. The report warns that underestimation of the severity of this emerging risk may lay open securities markets to a black swan event.”

A survey of 46 exchanges around the world found that 53% had faced cyber attacks – mostly disruptive in nature, rather than financially motivated, and mostly consisting of malware or DDoS attacks. Nearly all – 89% – of those surveyed agreed that cybercrime should be considered a systemic risk.",1
"It’s every Amazon Alexa owner’s worst nightmare – your private conversations not just being listened to, but shared with random contacts without your knowledge.

I don’t have an voice-activated assistant in my home.

Call me paranoid if you like, but I just don’t like the idea of some internet-enabled gadget always “listening” to what’s being said, waiting to hear if it’s being given a voice command. By my reckoning I’ve survived just fine for forty-cough years without a voice-activated assistant, so I’ll probably be just fine without one.

But lots of people have bought into the likes of the Amazon Alexa Echo, the Google Home, or the Apple HomePod, so maybe I’m just a dinosaur.

Well, if I am a Diplodocus I’m a slightly smugger Diplodocus this morning, as I read what one woman claims happened to her.

Danielle, who declined to provide her last name to CBS News affiliate Kiro7, says that she was having a private conversation with her husband… in her home which has a number of Amazon Alexa Echo devices.

All was fine until one day, out of the blue, one of her husband’s employees rang the house from his home 176 miles away in Seattle.

The employee’s message? “Unplug your Alexa devices right now… You’re being hacked.”

Somehow Danielle’s husband’s colleague had been sent a recording of the their private conversation. Danielle and her husband were skeptical at first that that could have happened, but then the conversation was played back to them down the phone and they couldn’t believe that they were hearing their private conversation replayed back to them.

Thankfully the conversation wasn’t embarrassing – simply a discussion of hardwood floors – but imagine how much sensitive or awkward things could have been?

“I felt invaded,” Danielle told Kiro 7. “A total privacy invasion. Immediately, I said, ‘I’m never plugging that device in again because I can’t trust it’.”

You can see the story in Danielle’s own words in this Kiro7 TV news report:

Danielle contacted Amazon directly to find out what had happened, and asked to be given a guarantee that it wouldn’t happen again.

An Amazon Alexa technician spoke to Danielle, confirmed that it was the voice-activated digital assistant that had recorded the conversation, and apologised.

But how did the privacy breach occur? Amazon gave the following explanation to the world’s curious press:

“Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like ‘Alexa.’ Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a ‘send message’ request. At which point, Alexa said out loud ‘To whom?’ At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customers contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, ‘[contact name], right?’ Alexa then interpreted background conversation as ‘right’. As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.”

Even if Amazon’s description of how the private conversation was sent to a random contact is correct, the fact that the chances of it happening to you are small is not that much consolation when you consider just how many millions of Amazon Alexas have been sold. Recent statistics suggest that more than one in four households have a smart speaker in their home, so a tiny percentage risk can still amount to a sizeable problem.

Danielle, however, does not believe the explanation offered. She says that she was stood right next to the Amazon Alexa device while she had the conversation, and that its volume was turned up to level 7. She believes she would have noticed if the device had behaved as Amazon describes.

Not only is Danielle not buying the description of how Alexa went wrong, she’s also not buying any more voice-activated devices from Amazon – and is waiting to see if she will be given a refund.",1
"A breach which has leaked personal data for two million Vodafone Germany customers has ben claimed to be the work of an insider, according to Vodafone.

A breach which has leaked personal data for two million Vodafone Germany customers has been claimed to be the work of an insider, according to Vodafone. The company warned the leak could lead to increased risk of targeted phishing attacks.

Customers’ names, birthdates, addresses leaked – as well as their bank account and branch numbers, Vodafone Germany admitted. The company said that passwords, PIN numbers and credit card details were safe.

“This attack could only be carried out with high criminal intent and insider knowledge and was launched deep inside the IT infrastructure of the company,” Vodafone said, according to a report by Phys.org. The information was stolen from a database within the company network, according to the BBC.

Vodafone said that the attackers had not gained access to enough information to access clients’ bank accounts – but that the data could raise the risk of “phishing” attacks. Only German customers were afffected by the attack, Vodafone said, and those afffected would be contacted by post.

“Vodafone deeply regrets the incident and apologises to all those affected,” the company said, adding that it was now working with police, and that one suspect had been identified.

“In coordination with the authorities, Vodafone Germany is now fully informing all affected persons and supporting them in avoiding possible adverse effects.”

ESET Senior Research Fellow David Harley says, “ The real risk to everyday customers partly depends on how much of the stolen data has been shared with other criminals, which isn’t clear from the story. In any case, from the sound of it, not enough data have been exfiltrated for a direct attack on customers en masse. However, there is the risk of some kind of data aggregation attack where the information that has been shared is used to give credibility to a phishing-type email.”

Information such as customer names and addresses can be useful to attackers, Harley warns.

“In general, the weakness of generic phishing is that the attacker doesn’t have information specific to potential victims, so mails out emails addressed non-specifically to ‘Dear Valued Customer’ or something similar. If a victim reads an email with his actual name and minimal account details, even a phish-savvy customer may be more inclined to trust it. However, s/he can reduce the risk by being sceptical about all emails asking for sensitive information and revalidation of account information and assume that any links are likely to be malicious. Banks don’t (or shouldn’t) send such requests by email, which is more likely to be used for marketing purposes. In general, customers shouldn’t click or follow up on any link in email that asks for customer-specific information. If you think it might be genuine, go to a link that you know is genuine.”

A detailed ESET guide to phishing scams can be found here.

“However, it’s a lot more effort to mail out semi-personalized phish messages in any quantity, and I’m not sure how likely it is that a scammer will go to that trouble.”

“As for insider attacks, there’s no totally effective way of preventing someone with privileged access misusing that access, as the NSA will testify. However, a business can minimize the risks by being all the more careful about vetting people in roles that allow them such access, ensuring that people who don’t need that access don’t have it (for instance, when they change roles) and so on. Obviously, the use and diligent maintenance of technical controls like internal firewalling also has a bearing. Clearly, not all attackers are on the outside.”",1
"Have you spoke to your kids lately? We bet if you have, then you are all too familiar with what they tend to talk about – video games. While you may still be clueless about the ins and outs, its worth reading up on online gaming, as there are plenty of risks you never knew possible.

Have you spoken to your kids lately? We bet if you have, then you are all too familiar with what they tend to talk about – video games. Cheats, mods or blocks … you’ve certainly heard it all before but needless to say, you’re still clueless as to what any of that means.

Take for instance Minecraft, a really popular game that allows you to enjoy a range of activities, including building castles, exploring unknown areas and digging your own catacombs. How much about it do you really know?

Would it surprise you to learn that you can do all of the above without a specific goal or ending or that it has unexpectedly become the third most sold game in history (70 million copies sold on all platforms)? It’s extremely popular and the list of its registered users is now 100 million strong, most of them teenagers and youngsters between the ages of 15 and 21 (43.7%).

While all of this is fascinating, there are other, more important things to be conscious of, especially as a parent. For example, Minecraft is one of many games that can be played live – i.e. online. Any gaming environment like this, which is made of a huge number of anonymous players, comes with risks.

For example, it is really easy for cybercriminals or even sexual predators to be among the innocent gamers, who are simply there to have fun. Acting as your kid’s peer, these lawless individuals can obtain sensitive personal information, including passwords and credit card data, as well manipulate them into doing things they wouldn’t and shouldn’t normally do.

Teenagers, by virtue of being more independent, may not know what’s happening, nor actively seek to discuss any concerns they may have with their mom or dad. But this should however not stop you from actively helping them to avoid the pitfalls before it spirals out of control. Here’s what you can do.

First, make sure they only use secure devices for gaming, which comes with a security solution installed, updated and up and running. This applies not only for the desktop computer at home or their favorite laptop, but also for their smartphones and other mobile devices.

Secondly, explain to them that playing cheat or cracked version of a game is asking for trouble. Though many of them might be cheaper or even free, they most likely come laden with malware. Look at ways in which you can help them buy an original game instead, giving them part of the money back if they offer to pay for a portion of it themselves. A few extra dollars/pounds/euros is worth the security that comes with an authentic, uncompromised game.

Thirdly, if you want to be sure that the communication channels stay open, even with your teenage child, consider investing in parental control solutions. There is so much more to these tools than imposing seemingly draconian limits on your kids (as teenagers perhaps see it). Such an app provides your youngsters with a voice, which treats them like an adult. Encourage them to ask for permissions to play certain games, the details of which you can then negotiate. It also makes it easy to block websites, which might be risky or display inappropriate content.

Finally, last but not least, keep talking to them. Make it clear that not everybody they meet online – especially in online games and fora – is their friend. If possible, kids should play only with people they know in the real world. If not, teach them to be very careful about whom they talk to and watch for red flags – such as offers for the sharing of personal information and extending relationships outside of the game.",1
"Maybe it’s time to think twice before rushing to click on a link, next time your favourite celebrity says something bizarre on Twitter.

A few years ago I joked that the only reason I followed Britney Spears on Twitter was to get an early heads-up on when she next had her account hacked.

Actually, thinking back, I wasn’t joking.

It felt like barely a month went by without the singer having her account compromised.

And if her high profile account was exploited, chances were that plenty of her adoring fans were also likely to blindly click on the links without thinking of the possible consequences (too obvious ones being a phishing attack or a malware infection).

Here’s an example from January 2009, when Britney Spears had a lowly 14,000 followers. (Today she has over 36 million. Wow, hasn’t time moved on?)

Well, time has moved on and Britney’s superstar status has diminished a little. After all, there are new kids on the block like Justin Bieber.

Bieber, who like the Britney of old appears to be going through a public car-crash for the benefit of the paparazzi, has an astonishing 50 million followers on Twitter.

And anyone with that kind of social media audience becomes an obvious attraction to social media scammers and online criminals.

Sure enough, this weekend, Justin Bieber appeared to be no longer in charge of his Twitter account – at least for a short time – as messages appeared in Indonesian linking to an Android app called Shooting Star Pro.

Within seconds, Bieber’s fanatical followers were favoriting and retweeting his message regardless, one assumes, of whether they were able to understand them.

Cemberut, by the way, is an Indonesian word meaning sullen or grumpy, and is sometimes used by social media users alongside downcast selfies of themselves.

What isn’t clear is how Bieber’s account was compromised. Did he, or whoever manages his social media accounts, authorise a rogue third party app to post on the Twitter account without thinking of the possible consequences, was he specifically targeted or was someone careless with their password?

Whatever the reason for the unexpected tweets, a warning was quickly posted on the account advising followers not to click on the links.

That link from earlier. dont click it. virus. going to erase this now. spread the word. thanks

Later that message was deleted, and replaced with another claiming that everything was now under control:

all good now. we handled it.

Scammers, spammers and online criminals love to take advantage of innocent people’s social media accounts, because it’s a very effective launchpad for their money-making campaigns.

It’s not just celebrities like Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and Kevin Bacon who fall victim. Many regular members of the public have their social networking accounts compromised every day, and it’s their online friends and family who are duped as a result into visiting dangerous links, believing it is their pal or loved one who shared them.

Always be sure to take care over your passwords (ensuring you only enter them on the legitimate site for which they were designed, and not reusing the same password), be cautious over what third-party apps you grant access to your account, and take advantage of features like two factor authentication to better control access to your accounts.

And maybe it’s time to think twice before rushing to click on a link, next time your favourite celebrity says something bizarre on Twitter.

By the way, while we’re talking about two factor authentication, it’s worth remembering that it’s a good additional protection which can be applied in many parts of your online life – not just on Twitter. Companies looking to harden their defences might consider solutions like ESET Secure Authentication.",1
"All too commonly API security is something of an afterthought, says ESET’s Cameron Camp at this year’s VMworld. This needs to change.

The VMware ecosystem has become huge and now encompasses a daunting number of platforms that you don’t even think about, including many in the IoT world. But now, all of these devices have to talk to each other in order to get along, and they do that with Application Program Interfaces (API). Are APIs all secure? If not, rogue processes can slurp off huge volumes of information and port it all off silently. Clearly, APIs are a point of heavy security focus, or should be. But all too commonly API security is something of an afterthought.

VMworld highlights all the ways in which you can move not only volumes of data (see also my previous piece about the lack of data visibility), but entirely different types of information between systems. For example, virtualized technology is being used to control industrial equipment gateways to keep cranes from colliding with other equipment – in real time – or to at least alert operators that doom may be impending.

As the ecosystem becomes larger, there must be a common way in which various machines can request – and sometimes direct – other machines to get or act on information. This is done through an interface designed to be simple for machines to efficiently speak to each other.

“The problem is that the API is often the last item that gets built into a software application.”

The problem is that the API is often the last item that gets built into a software application, if at all. It’s easy to see why, as the rush to market – as well as stopping the engineering cash bleed – is the primary imperative in many software projects, and then, oh by the way, we need an API.

While the API is one of the last features to get any serious attention, it is often one of the first used to bolt all the interoperable systems together. This means securing the API was almost certainly not a top priority. It also means that once a series of machines start interacting with each other, it’s very difficult (and often unrewarding) to update that interface, for fear that it will stop communications altogether, or at least break badly.

So while there may be some code review, especially on the core aspects of the program that’s being built, it’s a much more nuanced understanding of the interaction between your program and lots of others who might interact with its information.

It’s somewhat redeeming that many API’s simply produce a small subset of information via read-only interfaces, but sometimes it’s necessary to have API’s control a machine directly. Obviously, this opens a software ecosystem up to new potential threats, which can be hard to contain without significant security experience.

Most projects build an API based on a given set of requirements at that time. But as the needs change, use cases grow, and security becomes more of a factor. So it becomes increasingly difficult to really think holistically about API security, especially if it stands to break lots of other things.

But here we are at VMworld, while we’re thrilled that more and more machines and doodads seem to be talking, we hope that security is in the conversation. Do we always know what the API’s are spewing out? Penetration testing the API layer would seem to be a natural step in development, and while it may not always happen, yet as the perimeter becomes less defined, making sure the API is only sharing information it’s supposed to becomes a more daunting problem. Hopefully, however, more effort will start to be directed towards the API layer, so that everyone can be sure the API isn’t suddenly behaving badly, or doing things no one knows about until it’s too late.",1
"The security update won’t necessarily help users who have already been infected with the bootkit as TDL4 blocks the Windows Update service on x86 machines. As a result, infected x86 machines won’t be able to download and install the patch automatically.

[An interesting snippet from my colleagues Aleksander Matrosov and Eugene Rodionov – DH]

Not so long ago, Microsoft released a security patch addressing the way Windows x64 operating systems check integrity of the loaded modules. In our recent report (The Evolution of TDL4: Conquering x64) we described a method used by the TDL4 bootkit to load its malicious unsigned driver on 64-bit systems, even though those systems have an enforced kernel-mode code signing policy. The new security update is intended to fix the “feature” (vulnerability) in x64 OS's (Windows Vista and later) exploited by TDL4.

On unpatched systems there are three BCD (Boot Configuration Data) options that determine the way the OS checks integrity of the kernel-mode modules:

BcdLibraryBoolean_DisableIntegrityCheck – instructs the system to disable kernel-mode code integrity checks (used for debugging purposes, for instance)

BcdOSLoaderBoolean_WinPEMode – instructs the system to disable kernel-mode code integrity checks (switched on when OS is loaded in preinstallation mode) ¬ exploited by TDL4

BcdLibraryBoolean_AllowPrereleaseSignatures – instruct the system to use special prerelease digital certificates to verify digital signatures of kernel-mode modules.

On a patched system only two of these are left: BcdLibraryBoolean_DisableIntegrityCheck and BcdLibraryBoolean_AllowPrereleaseSignatures. BcdOSLoaderBoolean_WinPEMode BCD option is no longer used in the initialization of code integrity policy. The routine BlImgQueryCodeIntegrityBootOptions in winload.exe returns the value that determines code integrity policy. In the figure below the patched BlImgQueryCodeIntegrityBootOptions routine is presented.

Here we notice that BcdOSLoaderBoolean_WinPEMode is no longer used (as it was in the unpatched routine) and therefore TDL4’s trick of substituting kdcom.dll won’t work.

There is one mode module patched in the security update: kdcom.dll. This reinforces the conjecture that the security update specifically addresses TDL4 infection. As we already know, TDL4 replaces the kdcom.dll library with its own malicious component at boot time. The bootkit identifies kdcom.dll by the size of its export directory (it is compared with 0xFA):





In the patched version of kdcom.dll, the size of the export directory has been changed. If we look into its export directory (figure below) we notice that an exported symbol KdReserved0 has been added which is not present in unpatched library.

This function is added with only one obvious purpose: to increase the size of the export directory and as a result prevent the TDL4 bootkit from replacing it.

The security update won’t necessarily help users who have already been infected with the bootkit as TDL4 blocks the Windows Update service on x86 machines. As a result, infected x86 machines won’t be able to download and install the patch automatically. On an x64 OS things are rather different and the Windows Update Service is not blocked by the bootkit, so the security update can be downloaded and installed.

Although the patch helps with this particular case it doesn’t solve the problem in general. There are other ways of penetrating into kernel-mode address space on x64 operating systems, for instance, as in the case of the Chinese bootkit which is detected as NSIS/TrojanClicker.Agent.BJ (VirusTotal). This uses quite a different approach to load its unsigned driver.

In his summary of New Year predictions by security researchers here at ESET, Stephen Cobb pointed to expanded efforts by malware authors to target the Linux operating system. Looks like that might be right: A blog post published by Sucuri yesterday describes a backdoored version of the SSH daemon discovered on compromised servers. Interestingly, this backdoor was used in conjunction with the malicious Apache module Linux/Chapro.A that we blogged about recently.

The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a very popular protocol used for secure data communication. It is widely used in the Unix world to manage remote servers, transfer files, etc. The modified SSH daemon described here, Linux/SSHDoor.A, is designed to steal usernames and passwords and allows remote access to the server via either an hardcoded password or SSH key.

The strings related to the hidden behaviors are XOR encoded. This is done to avoid easy identification by searching the binary for suspicious strings. We identified a total of 16 encoded strings. The figure below shows the part of the code responsible for decoding the hidden data by xoring it with the constant 0x23.

The HTTP protocol is used to send stolen data to a remote server. The information is first encrypted using a 1024-bit RSA key stored in the binary and then Base64 encoded. The data is sent via an HTTP POST request to the server used for data exfiltration.

The binary we analyzed contains two hostnames for servers used to collect data: openssh.info and linuxrepository.org. Both names were probably chosen to avoid raising suspicions from the administrators of the compromised servers. At this point in time, both hostnames point to a server hosted in Iceland with IP 82.221.99.69.

When the daemon is started, the backdoor sends the IP and port on which the service is running and the hostname of the server.

Whenever a user successfully logs onto the compromised server, the username and password are also sent to the remote server.

In addition to stealing credentials, the backdoor guarantees persistence on the compromised host for the attacker in two different ways. First, it has a hard-coded password inserted in the code. If any user logs in using this password, he is automatically granted access to the compromised server. The following figure shows the string comparison between the password provided by a user trying to log in and the hardcoded password.

Second, the modified binary also carries an SSH key. If a user logs into the server with the private key corresponding to the hard-coded public key, he is automatically granted access.

The backdoor can also retrieve configuration data from the file /var/run/.options. If this file exists the backdoor will use the hostname, backdoor password and SSH key stored in it. The variables are stored one per line in cleartext.

As with Linux/Chapro.A, it is hard to tell how this Trojanized SSH daemon made its way on a compromised server but outdated applications or weak passwords are probably to blame. Finding backdoored files can be problematic for most system administrators. We recommend regular use of integrity checking tools plus monitoring of outgoing network connections and regular scanning of all files by an antivirus product. This threat is detected by ESET as Linux/SSHDoor.A.

With nearly 160,000 lust-ridden techies, corporate denizens and a few of us security types descending on a slightly crisp wintery Las Vegas to see what all the fuss is about at CES 2015, here are a few things to keep an eye out for this year at the show:

Your car will be connected – (and not necessarily to you as a driver):

There is a steady, hypnotic automaker drumbeat that promises a new car where it can do the driving all by itself, thank you. Tired of fighting distraction? Just give in, swivel your captain’s chair around and have a conference while you drive; the car will notify you when you get there. When can I buy one? That depends on whose presentation you listen to, but slowly they’ll be oozing onto the scene, if only to poise squarely against Google, heretofore considered the leader in this space. Wait for us, we’re the carmakers, and we’ll have something really soon now, we promise. Shopping sprees writ large – and not just by consumers:

In the face of what is an increasingly breakneck development cycle for the latest gadgets, why not just give in and build a brand by seeing who can be purchased to build your tasty ecosystem? After all, if customers dogpile on a new gadget, that’s a good indication that they have a hit, so your team doesn’t have to do the guesswork. How big of a check? How big of a buzz on the show floor may be a better question. How absorbed are we anyway in the Android vs. iOS borg, or will there be any plausible newcomers?

Should we just collectively admit defeat and work on something else besides an operating system? Hasn’t the “North vs. South” of Google vs. Apple been pretty solidly laid out? Well, sort of. Here we have a sharply polarized development strategy, namely that you can easily port Android, and not as easily port Apple things. Apple is proud of its ecosystem, but Android allows a more free-wheeling “get there very quickly and let the consumer decide” approach, and here at CES, that’s definitely an edge. And there’s a wildcard on the horizon: open source developers who feel that they can “roll their own” and make it happen. We’ll see. How much do we care if our e-fridge is connected?

I mean, sure, it’s nice to have tasty recipes displayed in a tailored manner on your fridge’s built-in HD display, but is it enough to differentiate in the market yet? Sure, eventually all your appliances will bring you the latest connected information, but do we care enough now to buy one? The manufacturers seem to be betting on it. And anyway, this is CES, so we get to sample a flood of aspirational views of what the future might look like. Maybe. Someone’s finally focused on security:

Or so we’re told. In the coming days we get to poke around and find out whether security is just a cheap veneer, or whether some plausible players have gotten it right and baked it in from the ground up. Here, it will be interesting to see whether they use more tried-and-true security implementations (see #3 about the OS mashup), or just parachuted in some vanilla operating system that works well enough to move on to the whizz-bang aspects of development that the manufacturers hope will help sell millions. We hope the market is maturing a bit and recognizes the value of security, and we hope the consumers will force the issue. Maybe we can only In the coming days we’ll report back with a deeper look.

So stay tuned that we are covering the International Consumers Electronics Show 2015 direct from Las Vegas and will be talking about digital invasion and privacy concerns in the next post!

Our colleagues in ESET Latin America have just blogged about an interesting botnet creation tool: the original blog is at http://blogs.eset-la.com/laboratorio/2010/05/14/botnet-a-traves-twitter/, by Jorge Mieres and Sebastián Bortnik, Security Analysts. (Mistakes in interpretation are, as usual, down to me!)

In the last years we have seen many security incidents driven by botnets and exploiting the technologies currently most popular, in order to spread infection: social networks are an example we've often highlighted.

In the last few hours we have found an application that is currently in-the-wild. This application has been developed to automate the creation of botnets where communication between the botmaster and the zombie systems under his control is performed through Twitter, the best known microblogging network. (A zombie system is one that is controlled remotely through an agent that has been infectively installed on the system.) Here is an image of the builder program, detected by ESET NOD32 Antivirus as MSIL/Agent.NBW:

This is a very simple application designed to automate the creation of bot Trojans. The development of these programs pretend to be as intuitive as possible in a sort of ""applications-for-dummies"" way. In this case, it only requires the creation of a Twitter profile for use for launching commands to the infected computer.

To build the malware, the attacker needs only to type in the username that will send instructions to the zombie computers. The trojan generated through this builder is malicious code that, by infecting a system, will receive commands launched via social networking. In other words, the attacker can control infected computers via the content type in his Twitter profile.

The bot created has a basic command set that allows the botmaster to interact with infected computers. For example:

The command DDOS * IP * PORT performs a Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS)

With DOWNLOAD * LINK / MALWARE.EXE can download other malicious code

The command REMOVEALL automatically deletes information relating to the bot from the infected system

In order to illustrate this process better, we have developed an educational video where you can watch the entire process, from the creation of the malware by the attacker, to the infection of the system and finally, the execution of a Distributed Denial of Service Attack through the zombies that comprise the botnet. The video gives step-by-step explanations as the attack proceeds: video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoATrwF4DdM



It is worth mentioning that all users of ESET products are protected, since the malware is proactively detected through our ThreatSense engine.

BlackBerry has signed up to FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance – a group which is seeking to establish new methods to identify people quickly and safely, rather than relying on passwords for mobile security.

FIDO is supported by internet giants such as Google and PayPal and is investigating alternative authentication technologies such as NFC chips, biometrics and one-time passwords, with a view to creating a standards-based system for passwordless authentication.

BlackBerry’s statement mentions services such as BBM and Protect, but is not specific about technologies or systems it might develop alongside FIDO.

Fan site CrackBerry said, “It’s easy to imagine this technology enabling BlackBerry devices to become security tokens in their own right for two-factor authentication. For example, you could set your PayPal account so that it could only authenticate transfers made from your BlackBerry since it has a unique and certified identity. Alternatively, you could set it so that with an additional PIN number punched in on the device, you could open doors with electronic locks, or start your car.”

“BlackBerry is deeply committed to remaining the Gold Standard in mobile security while providing a model for others to adopt and follow,” said Brian McBride, Technical Director for Identity at BlackBerry. “Offering safe, reliable access for our customers across the globe is inherent to everything BlackBerry does as an organization.”

FIDO aims to replace passwords with a secure, industry-supported protocol which is also easy to use. FIDO is investigating technologies such as fingerprint scanners, voice and facial recognition, and existing solutions such as Near Field Communication (NFC) and One Time Passwords (OTP), with a view to creating an integrated solution.

“BlackBerry is among the first mobile platform and mobile device suppliers to engage with the FIDO Alliance to equip customers with easy-to-use strong authentication, allowing them to easily move from site to site securely without having to enter identifying information multiple times,” FIDO said in a statement.

PayPal have been vocal this year in their support of the group’s aims.

“Passwords are running out of steam as an authentication solution. They’re starting to impede the development of the internet itself,” PayPal’s Chief Information Security Officer Michael Barrett said at the Interop Las Vegas IT expo earlier this year.

“It’s pretty clear that we can’t fix it with a proprietary approach.”

Mr Barrett pointed out the results of passwords being published online after data breaches in recent years – showing that insecure passwords such as “12345” and “password” remain among the most commonly used

“Users will pick poor passwords – and then they’ll reuse them everywhere,” says Barrett. “That has the effect of reducing the security of their most secure account to the security of the least secure place they visit on the internet.”

No password can keep you entirely safe – a data breach may occur at the company or institution you are dealing with, and cybercriminals have all the time in the world to crack lists of encrypted passwords. Choosing a good one, though, will give you time to change yours once the news breaks. Check out ESET’s guide to password hygiene for more advice.",1

Fighting modern day piracy is something of a paradox; in an open system that allows freedom (good), scoundrels are also free to skulk around doing nasty things (bad). Various efforts have been made to pounce on evildoers, but it’s a game of whack-a-mole. When one has been thwarted, others pop up as variations on the same theme. In a recent report, the Brookings Institute floats the idea that modern piracy is a variation on the high seas hijinks of yesteryear, sans pirate patch and questionable grooming, and should be combated in similar ways.

The difference, the report opines, is that combating pirates with ships and cannons required a central effort by governments, versus modern day efforts which will require efforts by private entities, specifically ISP’s. In the days of yore, specific chokepoints along navigable routes were identified and controlled by those who owned the waterway, usually a nation. In modern times, there are major network trunks here and there that serve as navigable routes to online seas over the visible horizon.

Shouldn’t this be left to governments? In Egypt’s recent struggle to rid Mubarak after an extended stay in power, one critical tactic used by his administration was to “flip the killswitch” on the internet, in an effort to stifle opposition and stall communication attempts. For many, ceding this level of control to officials would present a far-too-tempting lever for them, possibly utilized for nefarious purposes. Additionally, once a government gains this sort of control, they have a history of hanging on to it long after it seems beneficial to the populace.

It seems there are around 5,000 major ISP’s and carriers involved in the equation. In an internet measured in many billions of connecting points, that’s certainly a small number of potential chokepoints. So what are they supposed to do? Take an aggressive stance and clamp down on abettors of underground nonsense. This seems far simpler to opine than may be practical to implement.

For one thing, ISP’s stay in business by offering services customers want and feel have better value than the competition. If one ISP adopts a very restrictive crackdown and the competition doesn’t, customers may choose the more open option, unless they can be educated and value the new approach, a non-trivial feat. I have family members who use the same pet name for every password, I can imagine the difficulty of getting their adoption on this. So if there isn’t something of a “mutual drawdown” by all ISP’s, the more aggressive ones may find it difficult to woo customers, resulting potentially in disappointing earnings, a kiss of death in a competitive market. Also, every new control costs money in hardware and associated expert staff. This means the product may cost more to the customer, again tilting the scales toward the less restrictive vendor.

The wildcard in the equation is whether a critical mass of customers would be willing pay more for what they understand to have that kind of benefit. Either that, or pray the government will pass a law to MAKE various ISP’s take steps, all at the same time. The business community tends to resent this sort of additional meddling by often under-informed bureaucracies, due to the addition burden of forced compliance efforts, again affecting profits. So it’s a tricky proposition, but one that may have the attention of ISP’s and governments alike, and certainly the owners of the information being pirated.",1
"If you use an Android phone you may have heard of something called the USSD vulnerability. This allows a nasty piece of malicious software to reset your Android to its factory default settings and permanently delete your data.

If you use an Android phone you may have heard of something called the USSD vulnerability. This allows a nasty piece of malicious software to reset your Android to its factory default settings and permanently delete your data. We will describe the USSD problem in more detail in a moment but first we want to let you know that, because this is a particularly unpleasant case of malware destroying information, ESET has provided a free app available from Google Play to protect your Android phone from this type of attack.

The app is called ESET USSD Control. According to Tibor Novosad, Head of Mobile Applications Section at ESET: “ESET USSD Control is an application that allows the user to check potentially malicious phone numbers (USSD codes) before they are dialed (executed) by the default phone dialer. ESET USSD Control will block malicious websites [that abuse USSD codes] as well. Checking for malicious codes before they are executed, ESET USSD Control makes sure all data on an Android phone stays safe.”

How does ESET USSD Control work?

The app displays a warning window each time a malicious USSD code is found, blocking the execution of the command, as seen in the screenshot on the right.

In order to protect your Android smartphone from USSD attacks, you have to make sure that ESET USSD Control is set as the default dialer. Here’s how:

Download ESET USSD Control from Google Play and install on your Android phone. Use your Android phone to visit our test page: http://www.eset.com/tools/ussdtest (note that this only contains a checker and will not make changes to your phone). When prompted to complete the action, select Use by default for this action and select ESET USSD Control.

Note that ESET only scans USSD code and does not store phone numbers.

We hope this app will help keep your Android safe. We’re pleased to make this available free to the Android community as part of our continuing effort to support the Android ecosystem and to empower users to stay safe on their mobile devices.

The Android USSD Vulnerability

USSD is a code used by phone manufacturers and carriers for simple customer support. The letters stand for Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). The code starts with an asterisk (*) and continues with hashtags or digits representing commands/data, then ends with a hashtag (#). By entering these codes on your phone you can, for example, see your device’s IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The USSD code for this is *#06#. Other codes reveal different information or carry out actions, like a device reset.

The potential exists for a web page to instruct your phone to load a “tel:” URI (uniform resource identifier) with a special factory reset code inside an iframe. As Lucian Constantin at ComputerWorld reported, this attack was described by Ravishankar Borgaonkar, a research assistant in the Telecommunications Security department at the Technical University of Berlin, who demonstrated the remote data wiping attack during the Ekoparty security conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

These malicious iframes could be placed on hacked websites or specially designed sites. As you probably know, there are numerous ways to trick your smartphone into going to a website, like QR codes or NFC chips (as my colleague Stephen Cobb illustrated in a short video). With ESET USSD Control on your Android you won’t need to worry that such tricks will be used to wipe your phone via USSD codes.

"The short answer is the media wants a cyberwar.

The short answer is the media wants a cyberwar. Cyberwar is a dark, sexy, mysterious headline that sells and so each time something nefarious happens on the internet that potentially involves two or more countries, security experts are besieged with the question “Is this cyberwar”?

Let’s look back to the 1989 book by Clifford Stoll called “The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage”. In his book Stoll tells the true story of a German spy who was using the internet to steal US military information to sell to the Soviet KGB. Nobody was asking if it was cyberwar back then because the marketing term had not yet been invented, or at least heard of by the media, and everyone understood that this was simply a part of spying and espionage.

When radar was invented did the media ask “Is this electronic warfare”? Electronic warfare refers to the use of electronics in traditional warfare, but it not a separate type of war. Computers have long been used in warfare. During Operation Desert Storm, a war involving Iraq, the US, and troops from other countries, you can bet that computers were used extensively. Computers guided missiles to their targets. Computers received satellite information for a variety of purposes. The probability is that there was hacking and potentially malware involved as well. It will be many years before that information will be declassified, so one can only speculate right now. Robots designed to go in first and spot the enemy make extensive use of computers. Is this cyberwarfare? When there is a traditional war being conducted then it is understood that computers will be used and there usually are no questions about so called cyberwarfare. This changed a little when Russia invaded Georgia and simultaneously a crippling distributed denial of service attack was launched against Georgia. This was not a cyberwar, this was a battle that included a cyber component.

For many years now antivirus companies and others in the security space have battled viruses, trojans, and hacking attacks. The criminals behind the profit driven attacks are not cyberwarriors, they are more like information superhighway bandits.

So, when and where is the cyberwar? If we define cyberwar as a battle to control cyberspace, then the cyberwars are largely civil wars. China engages in a cyberwar against the Chinese people by controlling their access to cyberspace. Iran engages in cyberwar against dissidents internally. Potentially a proposed bill in the United States to make “wiretapping” of the internet easier may result in a cyberwar pitting the US government against its own citizens. It really comes down to how you wish to define cyberwar. Throughout history new technologies have come along and dramatically changed the nature of warfare. For me, the age old adoption of new technologies for use in spying and espionage is not a new type of warfare, it is business as normal. The use of new technologies in conventional warfare is nothing new either.



Stuxnet is a very sophisticated piece of malware but does not represent anything really new. For years now governments and individuals have used hacking techniques and malicious software to infiltrate and attempt to remotely control target computers. That Stuxnet is so sophisticated is part of the evolution of malware, not a paradigm shift in how warfare or espionage is conducted.

"If you have an account on link-shortening service Bitly, you should take steps now to protect your account.

If you have an account with the URL-shortening service Bitly you should read the “urgent security update” they have just published.

Bitly says it has reason to believe that its systems have been compromised, and account credentials could have fallen into the hands of hackers. However, the company says it doesn’t presently have any evidence that accounts have been accessed without proper authorisation.



We have reason to believe that Bitly account credentials have been compromised. We have no indication at this time that any accounts have been accessed without permission. For our users’ protection, we have taken proactive steps to ensure the security of all accounts, including disconnecting all users’ Facebook and Twitter accounts. All users can safely reconnect these accounts at their next login.

Something of a mystery remains about what happened. Bitly is currently declining to explain how it determined that the privacy of customer accounts had been breached, or what went wrong.

Furthermore, no details are shared regarding precisely what information the hackers might have got their hands on. For instance, if passwords were compromised were they in plaintext or hashed? If they were hashed, was it done securely with salting and other techniques to make it trickier for hackers to crack them?

Access to Bitly accounts might be attractive to criminals, because many are connected with users’ Facebook and Twitter profiles, opening the potential door for sending spam links and scam campaigns via the service. However, Bitly hasn’t confirmed if this has occurred and – in fairness to the service – it normally does a good job of blocking access to malicious links once they are reported to them.

What Bitly is happy to share, however, are instructions on what users should do next: reset your OAuth tokens, API key and password and then reauthorise any connected applications (such as Facebook and Twitter).

Following are step-by-step instructions to reset your API key and OAuth token: 1) Log in to your account and click on ‘Your Settings,’ then the ‘Advanced’ tab. 2) At the bottom of the ‘Advanced’ tab, select ‘Reset’ next to ‘Legacy API key.’ 3) Copy down your new API key and change it in all applications. These can include social publishers, share buttons and mobile apps. 4) Go to the ‘Profile’ tab and reset your password. 5) Disconnect and reconnect any applications that use Bitly. You can check which accounts are connected under the ‘Connected Accounts’ tab in ‘Your Settings.’

Many Bitly users are believed to have connected their accounts to their social media presences on the likes of Facebook and Twitter, but users will not be able to publish via Bitly to those sites until their profiles have been reconnected following the advice above.

It goes without saying that if you were using the same password for Bitly as any other website, you are playing a dangerous game. Change your password on Bitly, and choose new, different passwords for any other website or service where there is a risk that the same password could be used to open other parts of your online life.

Bitly’s CEO, Mark Josephson, signs off the advisory with an apology and a claim that the service takes security seriously:

We take your security and trust in us seriously. The team has been working hard to ensure all accounts are secure. We apologize for any inconvenience and we will continue to update our Twitter feed, @Bitly, as we have any further updates.

My hope is that Bitly will update its advisory in the near future with clearer information which will either put users’ minds at rest, or galvanise them into taking swifter action to protect themselves online.",1
"D-Link and Changing Information Technologies code-signing certificates stolen and abused by highly skilled cyberespionage group focused on East Asia, particularly Taiwan

ESET researchers have discovered a new malware campaign misusing stolen digital certificates.

We spotted this malware campaign when our systems marked several files as suspicious. Interestingly, the flagged files were digitally signed using a valid D-Link Corporation code-signing certificate. The exact same certificate had been used to sign non-malicious D-Link software; therefore, the certificate was likely stolen.

Having confirmed the file’s malicious nature, we notified D-Link, who launched their own investigation into the matter. As a result, the compromised digital certificate was revoked by D-Link on July 3, 2018.

The malware

Our analysis identified two different malware families that were misusing the stolen certificate – the Plead malware, a remotely controlled backdoor, and a related password stealer component. Recently, the JPCERT published a thorough analysis of the Plead backdoor, which, according to Trend Micro, is used by the cyberespionage group BlackTech.

Along with the Plead samples signed with the D-Link certificate, ESET researchers have also identified samples signed using a certificate belonging to a Taiwanese security company named Changing Information Technology Inc.

Despite the fact that the Changing Information Technology Inc. certificate was revoked on July ‎4, ‎2017, the BlackTech group is still using it to sign their malicious tools.

The ability to compromise several Taiwan-based technology companies and reuse their code-signing certificates in future attacks shows that this group is highly skilled and focused on that region.

The signed Plead malware samples are highly obfuscated with junk code, but the purpose of the malware is similar in all samples: it downloads from a remote server or opens from the local disk a small encrypted binary blob. This binary blob contains encrypted shellcode, which downloads the final Plead backdoor module.

The password stealer tool is used to collect saved passwords from the following applications:

Google Chrome

Microsoft Internet Explorer

Microsoft Outlook

Mozilla Firefox

Why steal digital certificates?

Misusing digital certificates is one of the many ways cybercriminals try to mask their malicious intentions – as the stolen certificates let malware appear like legitimate applications, the malware has a greater chance of sneaking past security measures without raising suspicion.

Probably the most infamous malware known to have used several stolen digital certificates is the Stuxnet worm, discovered in 2010 and the malware behind the very first cyberattack to target critical infrastructure. Stuxnet used digital certificates stolen from RealTek and one from JMicron, two well-known technology companies based in Taiwan.

However, the tactic is not exclusive to high-profile incidents like Stuxnet, as evidenced by this recent discovery.

"ISPs have started to monetize customer information quietly while selling them bandwidth. The temptation is strong, as that kind of aggregate data has real value on the secondary market, but what about the customers’ privacy?

It used to be that you paid for bandwidth from a provider and that’s exactly what you got. Now, with ever-expanding efforts to profit, ISPs have started to monetize customer information quietly while selling them bandwidth. The temptation is strong, as that kind of aggregate data has real value on the secondary market, but what about the customers’ privacy?

For years, computers, tablets, smartphones and other devices sold to consumers have been partially subsidized through large companies selling information about your Internet usage, such as browsing habits. Whether it’s a laptop, mobile device or home computer, it comes preloaded with software from third parties, who pay manufacturers to install programs that border on adware and spyware. This is one reason for the difference in price between computers sold to homes and businesses. Ever try to remove all the junk? It takes a dedicated tech expert, and even then it’s tough. The problem is so endemic that it has lead to the rise of a cottage industry of programs to remove it with names like Bulk Crap Uninstaller and Crap Cleaner. Some of this junkware could even hijack your traffic at a very low level, blurring the line of what actions are ethical by the manufacturers that make these deals. They may even introduce actual security vulnerabilities into computers.

Here at ESET, we usually get asked if we sell customer data to marketers; the answer is “no”. We have plenty to do just focusing on current threats and keeping customers safe. ISPs should do the same – stay focused on the technology to serve customers, not to sell their information to the highest bidder.

The issue is trust. Many people have no idea their information is being sold. If they did, there often was a monopoly or duopoly of internet providers in their area that provided broadband, and often those companies offered “take it or leave it” agreements, so you didn’t have a choice but to allow your information to be sold if you wanted to use their service. No? Try altering the agreement and sending it back to them (which you have legal right to do before you sign). You will likely not receive a warm response. Or, in some cases, you may have to pay extra for the privilege of not being tracked.

Keeping customer trust at the center of a business model certainly may hamper temporary quarter-by-quarter profit imperatives so prominent in publicly-traded companies, but if what you’re selling is trust and confidence, we think it will pay off in the end.

There is much work to be done providing adequate broadband to the U.S. (and the rest of the world) There are many areas that are either unserved or under-served, and customers there need broadband service to do their work. I am involved in a small ISP in an underserved rural area. We have opted not to sell any customer data to marketers in order not to establish a precedent I don’t think many customers would be comfortable with. But then in a small town you see customers in the store and want them to enjoy doing business with you and not have to look the other way.

I know ESET also cares deeply about what happens to customers, who are often in our own families, and who we have to answer to during social gatherings. I guess we could maximize profits by selling information, but it would set a precedent that doesn’t match who we are. Gaining trust takes years; losing it takes seconds. I hope the ISP industry, and other tech industries could focus a bit more on trust and a bit less on profits. If you gain trust, profits will follow.",1
"Some five million people who used their Gmail address as a user name had their passwords published by someone who apparently thinks that’s a cool thing to do. Changing you Gmail password now is a good idea.

[Updated to clarify that the Gmail account passwords exposed were not necessarily those for your Gmail account.]

According to reports that started to appear on Reddit and other forums on September 9, some five million account credentials were published that have a Gmail address as the user name. For example, if you subscribed to a newsletter on the finegardenz.com site using gthumb99@gmail.com as your user name and the password thumbsup then it is is possible this may have been made public. How? Possibly finegardenz.com was hacked at some point in the past.

The site where the data was published referred to itself as Bitcoin Security and the language of the site that published the email addresses with matching passwords is Russian.

Some people who reviewed the data said that in most cases, the passwords were five years old and did not allow access to their accounts. However, apparently some were still current and reports of attempts to use the credentials have been seen. The assumption is that this compromised data is a collection of credentials obtained by phishing campaigns or malware attacks over recent years.

A website called isleaked.com appeared during the day purporting to allow people to check if their Gmail address had been compromised. However, as of right now, it does not appear to be functioning correctly and frankly I would not go there. Instead, you can check your email address at this site — Have I been pwned — which is run by Troy Hunt, a trusted Microsoft MVP.

The Russian site CNews was the first to publish a story about the credentials and connected them to other recent leaks such as the one affecting Yandex, a popular search engine in Russia. Later TheDailyDot published a screenshot of leaked credentials belonging to Spanish, English and Russian speakers.

Representatives from Google and Yandex issued assurances that their systems had not been compromised, but as mentioned above, the keys had been stolen by phishing campaigns and unauthorized access to user accounts (in other words, not leaked by the system for which the credentials were created, but by users of those systems).

Obviously, Gmail account credentials themselves are of great value, given that they provide access to so many Google services, such as Google+ and Google Maps. Access to those two services alone could potentially reveal your home address and allow a stranger to see who your friends are. The lesson here is that if you use a Gmail address as a user name at some site or online service, you should NOT use your Gmail password with that. Remember: different passwords for different sites/services.

For safety’s sake, I just went and changed my Gmail password and I suggest you consider doing the same, even though it is a real pain. I already have two-factor authentication enabled on my Google account and recommend you do this for Google and other accounts that support it. Here is a handy list for some popular services that offer 2FA:

If you want to implement two factor authentication for access to your website, there are a number of options available, including ESA which you can learn about here.

I hope this information helps. I also hope we see some arrests of the criminals who keep exposing other people’s private information: doing so is illegal in most countries and a total jerk move wherever you live. (I recently wrote about the need to pressure governments to act against cyber criminals.)

Big hat tip to Sabrina Pagnotta of ESET LATAM office for her early reporting and research on this news.",1
"The attack itself unfolded within the span of two minutes on March 7. Hackers made a flurry of automated transactions that involved the digital currencies Viacoin (VIA) and Bitcoin (BTC).

One of the world’s largest digital currency exchanges is offering the equivalent of $250,000 in virtual money to anyone who helps track down the perpetrators of an attempted cryptocurrency heist last week.

“Binance is offering a $250,000 USD equivalent bounty to anyone who supplies information that leads to the legal arrest of the hackers involved in the attempted hacking incident on Binance on March 7th, 2018,” reads the exchange’s ‘wanted poster’.

The bounty would be paid out in BNB, which is Binance’s own digital coin. In addition, the China-based exchange announced that it has set aside $10 million worth in digital currency reserves for rewards vis-à-vis future hacking attempts.

The company’s twist on bug bounty programs – which many organizations use to incentivize legitimate individuals to report security vulnerabilities rather than attackers – has generated a great deal of media buzz. Binance has justified its move by the need for counteroffensive.

“To ensure a safe crypto community, we can’t simply play defense. We need to actively prevent any instances of hacking before they occur, as well as follow through after-the-fact. Even though the hacking attempt against Binance on March 7th was not successful, it was clear it was a large-scale, organized effort. This needs to be addressed,” reads the company’s announcement.

The foiled attack

The incursion took place after a long-term phishing campaign against Binance customers, according to an announcement by Binance last week. The campaign relied on a well-known technique called ‘homograph attack’, which involves the deceptive use of a character or characters, in the website address that is designed to look identical to the real one.

In this case, the phishing messages tricked the customers into entering their login credentials into a phony Unicode domain that looked “very much like binance.com, with the only difference being 2 dots at the bottom of 2 characters” (see image above).

The attack itself unfolded within the span of two minutes on March 7. Hackers made a flurry of automated transactions that involved the digital currencies Viacoin (VIA) and Bitcoin (BTC). Their ultimate aim was to empty a number of customer accounts that they had compromised via a phishing campaign in anticipation of the attempted heist.

Using custom-created API keys for the compromised accounts, the attackers instructed the accounts to sell BTC and buy VIA, thus driving the price of the latter high. Another 31 accounts, which the hackers had set up and loaded up with VIA in preparation for the heist, then sold the VIA in what effectively amounts to “an attempt to move the BTC from the phished accounts to the 31 accounts”, according to Binance.

Their efforts were ultimately thwarted after the suspicious trading activity triggered the exchange’s automatic risk management system, whereupon withdrawals were blocked and phony trades were reversed. As a result, the attackers were unable to cash out and, even worse for them, the exchange has frozen coins that they had deposited into the accounts created with an eye towards the scheme.

The attack is a continuation of the past trend, as various services in the cryptocurrency arena have been on the receiving end of all manner of cyber-incidents for several years now. We have also previously provided a snapshot of the calamities to befall this space in 2017. Earlier this year, Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck was stung by the theft of $530 million of virtual money, but it promised to reimburse the investors.",1

[Part 6 of an occasional series, updating a blog series I ran in early 2009 to reflect changes in the threat landscape. This series will also be available shortly as a white paper.]

Social Networks Can Be Very Anti-Social

Don’t disclose sensitive information on websites like FaceBook or LinkedIn if you can’t be sure that you can limit access to those data. Even information that in itself is innocuous can be combined with other harmless information and used in social engineering attacks.

In 2010, it’s more than likely that we’ll see increased targeting of social networks, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter in the US, and Orkut and Hi5 in South America. Attackers will be looking for data they can exploit from a social engineering standpoint, but they’ll also be looking for cross-site scripting and replicable malware attacks on the web sites as well as their APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

Data mining (both legitimate and criminal) will have a wider range of effects on individuals, and some of those effects will be far from beneficial. A notable example is Facebook’s lack of commitment to a realistic security model, which would be a very significant supplement to its rather generic security centre advice. It seems to me that Facebook is encouraging its users to share as much information as possible while essentially making them responsible for the security of their own data.

This isn’t unique to Facebook, of course, or even to Web 2.0 providers in general. But some such services are grooming us to accept that it’s legitimate for an ever-wider pool of data to be used to monitor our behaviour. It’s becoming harder to distinguish between appropriate and illicit use of personal data, in terms both of targeting advertised content and services, and of monitoring for security purposes by financial and governmental institutions, for instance. Lines are sometimes very blurred between legitimate and criminal data mining in some of these areas, and there are questions to be asked about validation: see http://www.eset.com/threat-center/blog/2009/12/14/your-data-and-your-credit-card and my article at, among other places, http://www.eurograduate.com/article.asp?id=3015&pid=1.

Privacy tends to diminish where it’s in the way of commercial rather than political interests. So, ironically enough, there will be particular and ongoing interest in data leakage where it affects public bodies, but selling on of information at the backdoor by more-or-less legal means will continue as it always has, though it’s starting to attract some attention. This may be less true in Europe, where data protection and other directives -already- give some formal weight to the principle that organizations should only hold as much personal data as they need, rather than what they want. On the other hand, the libertarian lobby in the US may eventually take more notice of this issue, and its potential influence is considerable.

" Apple has filed its official reply to the FBI’s demand that it write software to help the bureau access the iPhone of San Bernardino terrorism suspect Syed Farook. Consistent with its earlier public statements, Apple condemns the FBI’s request as an unprecedented expansion of government power that would endanger the privacy of Apple users. I expressed some skepticism of this argument last week, but I found Apple’s latest response pretty persuasive.    One danger is that an FBI win could set a legal precedent that puts us on a slippery slope to the routine use of smartphones for government surveillance. If Apple can be compelled to update the software on a dead suspect’s iPhone to help the FBI access encrypted data, it’s not obvious why the company couldn’t also be compelled to modify the software on a live suspect’s iPhone to listen in on his conversations or track his location. But let’s say you’re confident that the courts can draw a reasonable distinction between the FBI’s current request to unlock an encrypted iPhone and more outlandish surveillance scenarios. There’s still a big practical problem that the FBI and its allies haven’t really grappled with. iPhone hacking software will be a magnet for bad guys Every new version of the iPhone operating system goes through an extensive testing process before it’s signed by Apple. That’s critical because an iPhone will refuse to install software updates that haven’t been mathematically blessed by Apple. Given how dangerous it would be if someone tricked Apple into signing malware, we can assume that Apple takes extreme precautions to make sure that doesn’t happen.    But it will be hard for Apple to maintain high security standards if it is forced to create the hacking software the FBI has demanded. In its legal filing, Apple notes that ”there are hundreds of demands to create and utilize the software waiting in the wings. If Apple creates new software to open a back door, other federal and state prosecutors  —   and other governments and agencies  —   will repeatedly seek orders compelling Apple to use the software to open the back door for tens of thousands of iPhones.”    Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance alone has said there are at least 175 iPhones he’d like to have unlocked. Apple argues that if it is forced to create a hacked version of its software, that would ”force Apple to take on the task of unfailingly securing against disclosure or misappropriation the development and testing environments, equipment, codebase, documentation, and any other materials relating to the compromised operating system.”    The statement continued: ”Given the millions of iPhones in use and the value of the data on them, criminals, terrorists, and hackers will no doubt view the code as a major prize and can be expected to go to considerable lengths to steal it, risking the security, safety, and privacy of customers whose lives are chronicled on their phones.” We can assume that once Apple created the iPhone hacking software the FBI wants, hackers and foreign intelligence agencies would work to gain access to it. We can also expect that foreign governments will try to hack into the database Apple uses to track these requests  —   just as China hacked into a Google database that tracked Gmail surveillance requests. They might try to impersonate obscure local law enforcement agencies and submit forged court orders. Apple would need to hire new employees to process and investigate the growing volume of law enforcement requests  —   which would mean more people who could be subject to bribery or blackmail. Apple is a sophisticated company with a lot of security expertise. Maybe it will be able to withstand all these attacks and emerge with users’ privacy unscathed. But it’s a pretty big risk to take.  Here’s the situation between Apple and the FBI    ",1
" The S&P 500 and the Dow ended Tuesday’s session flat after mixed economic data and retail earnings, while the Nasdaq had another record close with help from technology stocks. U. S. manufacturing production showed its biggest increase in more than three years in April, bolstering a view that economic growth picked up early in the second quarter despite a surprise decline in homebuilding. Investors were also cautious about potential delays to the government’s tax and regulation reform agenda after reports late Monday that President Donald Trump disclosed highly classified information to Russia’s foreign minister about a planned Islamic State operation. ”There’s a lot of political data but not a lot of economic data that’s changing the landscape,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. Home improvement chain Home Depot ( ) reported a      performance, but TJX Cos Inc ( ) owner of T. J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, posted slowing   sales growth and a disappointing   profit forecast. ”It’s a combination of earnings and    industrial production, countered with concerns about future economic data and the fact we continue to see weak retail sales,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. ”With the consumer being more than   of economic growth, if consumer spending is weak, can we continue to see solid economic growth?” The Dow Jones Industrial Average   closed down 2. 19 points, or 0. 01 percent, to 20, 979. 75, and the S&P 500   lost 1. 65 points, or 0. 07 percent, to 2, 400. 67, easing from an intraday record high of 2, 405. 77. The Nasdaq Composite   added 20. 20 points, or 0. 33 percent, to 6, 169. 87, a record close for the index.  Only two of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors closed higher, with technology . SPLRCT providing the biggest boost. The sector rose 0. 5 percent, with an outsized boost from Microsoft ( ) which rose 2 percent.  Soros Fund Management disclosed late Monday that it more than tripled its stake in Microsoft, which also benefited from investors’ focus on security.  ”A lot of technology right now is driven by worries about cyber security, as investors believe more companies will have to upgrade their computer systems,” said Edward Jones’ Warne. Authorities around the globe scrambled to prevent hackers from spreading the ”WannaCry” ransomware that has infected more than 300, 000 computers in 150 countries.

"In the recent Equifax breach you may have noticed that people in the UK and Canada are also affected but there has been little clarification as to how many.

Update October 10, 2017: Equifax has updated their information pertaining to the stolen data from people in the UK and Canada. A file containing 15.2 million records dating from between 2011 and 2016 containing username, password, secret questions and answers, and partial credit card details from 693,665 people in the UK was also included in the attack. Equifax has also revised the total number of people in Canada affected by the breach down from 100,000 to 8,000.

Update October 02, 2017: Equifax has released more detailed information pertaining to the stolen data from people in Canada. The names, addresses, social insurance numbers (SIN) and, in limited cases, credit card numbers of up to 100,000 people in Canada may have been exposed.

Update September 15, 2017: Equifax has released more detailed information pertaining to the stolen data from people in the UK. The names, dates of birth, email addresses and telephone numbers of up to 400,000 people in the UK may have been accessed.

If you’ve been reading news about the recent Equifax breach, you may have noticed that many articles mention briefly that people in the United Kingdom and Canada are also affected. There has been little clarification as to how many people were affected, or what exactly was lost.

The current statement from Equifax is that there was “unauthorized access to limited personal information for certain UK and Canadian residents.” Due to this heavy emphasis on customers in the US, many of us have not really considered how much or how little this could mean to people in the UK and Canada.

Breach Maths

Certainly, in terms of total numbers and dramatic headlines, 143 million is a lot of victims. This means that 44 percent of all Americans could have been affected. If we assume that this breach primarily affects adults, it could be up to 60 percent of the population over the age of 18.

What we don’t currently know is how many people in the UK and Canada were affected. We know that Equifax has data on 820 million consumers worldwide and it operates in 24 countries. Of those 820 million, the company has information on 44 million people in the UK and 26 million in Canada.

If we assume again that this breach primarily affects adults, and if we assume that these numbers are the maximum number of possibly affected consumers in each country, this could mean that up to about 80 percent of adults in both countries may be affected.

While we do know that Equifax has found no evidence of unauthorized activity on their core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases, it’s entirely possible that this breach does not affect the total number of Equifax customers in either country. As much as anything, people are concerned about the lack of certainty.

Protect as if you’ve already been compromised

There is a popular saying in information security circles that says that everyone should protect their data as if they’ve already been compromised. While credit freezes were until recently considered a “drastic measure” – only for people who had already had identity theft-related fraud committed against them – they are now being widely recommended as a basic preventative measure for everyone. Equifax is now waiving fees for anyone wishing to set up this protection on their credit reports.

It seems wise, especially for people in the US, UK and Canada, to be extra vigilant until more specific information becomes available. Even if it turns out that few people in either country were affected, getting in the habit of double-checking what’s happening with your financial accounts and credit history is never a waste of time or effort.",1
"The attack, called “Thermanator”, could use your body heat against you in order to steal your credentials or any other short string of text that you have typed on a computer keyboard

A team of academics from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), have presented a type of attack that could enable a malefactor to retrieve sensitive information you entered via your keyboard – possibly up to a minute after you typed it.

The researchers had 30 users enter 10 different passwords, both strong and weak, on four common external keyboards. Using a thermal imaging camera, the researchers then scanned the residual heat left on the recently-pressed keys. In the second stage, they enlisted the help of eight non-experts in the field who, acting as “adversaries”, were asked to derive the set of pressed keys from the thermal imaging data – which they reliably did.

Long story short, the subjects successfully retrieved entire sets of key-presses that were captured by the camera as late as 30 seconds after the first key was entered. In addition, recovery of a partial set of key-presses was possible one minute after the first key was pressed, according to the researchers, who described their findings in a paper called “Thermanator: Thermal Residue-Based Post Factum Attacks On Keyboard Password Entry”. The pieces of the puzzle thus obtained could be easily leveraged for password-cracking attacks.

Password “passw0rd” thermal residue on the keyboard after 0, 15, 30, and 45 seconds after entry (University of California, Irvine)

“If you type your password and walk or step away, someone can learn a lot about it after-the-fact,” said one of the paper’s authors, Gene Tsudik.

“Being warm-blooded, human beings naturally prefer environments that are colder than their internal temperature,” reads the paper. “Because of this heat disparity, it is inevitable that we leave thermal residue on numerous objects that we routinely touch, especially, with bare fingers.”

A study back in 2011 showed that PIN codes entered on cash machines can also be recovered by analyzing the residual heat left behind on the keypads.

Meanwhile, the study on “Thermanator” also revealed that hunt-and-peck typists would be particularly susceptible to this attack, given the larger fingerprint and thermal trace that they leave on each key. Touch typists are safer, since they create more thermal noise by resting their fingers on the “home row” (i.e. “ASDF” and “JKL;” keys for the left and right hands, respectively).

A number of conditions need to be met for the attack to work. Notably, the victim must step away or be enticed away from their system shortly after inputting their sensitive information, and the camera must have an uninhibited view of the keyboard.

Either way, according to the paper, this “new post factum insider attack” poses a new credible threat for password-based systems, not least because “formerly niche sensing devices become less and less expensive”.

Mitigations

The paper suggests a number of mitigations that should make retrieving the data impossible or at least much more difficult. They include running one’s hands along the keyboard after inputting sensitive information or typing random “chaff” in order to introduce “thermal noise” into the residues left on key presses.

Other “antidotes” include using the mouse to select password characters on an on-screen keyboard. However, this may in turn increase your exposure to shoulder-surfing attacks, where someone peeks over your shoulder while you input sensitive information.

Additional – but apparently rather impractical countermeasures – include wearing insulating gloves. Or even fake nails, as the study found that wearing long acrylic fingernails was enough to be immune to Thermanator. We wouldn’t blame you if you opted for a different countermeasure, however.",1
" Bangladesh’s central bank has hired a U. S. lawyer for a potential lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York after hackers stole $81 million from its account with the NY Fed, according to an internal report by the Bangladesh bank. After the report surfaced on Tuesday in the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka, U. S. Representative Carolyn Maloney called for a probe of last month’s cyber attack on Bangladesh Bank. In one of the largest cyber heists in history, the hackers ordered the New York Fed to transfer $81 million from Bangladesh central bank funds to accounts in the Philippines. “This brazen heist from the Bangladesh central bank’s account at the New York Fed threatens to undermine the confidence that foreign central banks have in the Federal Reserve, and in the safety and soundness of international monetary transactions,” Maloney, a New York Democrat, said in a statement.      The U. S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is helping investigate the heist, which led to the ouster of Bangladesh’s central bank governor. Maloney also sent a letter to New York Fed President William Dudley, requesting a private meeting with bank staff to discuss the cyber fraud.  She said she wants to ask a series of questions, including whether it is appropriate to rely solely on the SWIFT global bank messaging system to authenticate outgoing payments from foreign central bank accounts. Her comments are the first sign that the attack could gain political traction in the United States. The New York Fed has faced separate political criticism since the financial crisis for missteps and perceived conflicts of interest in its role as the central bank’s top Wall Street regulator. “We fully intend to reach out to the congresswoman and will endeavor to address her questions,” a New York Fed spokeswoman said on Tuesday.  The New York Fed, which holds the accounts of some 250 foreign central banks and governments, has previously said very little publicly about the heist, beyond a March 9 statement that the payments were made in the usual way and that there was no evidence its systems were compromised.  The office of the Fed’s Investigator General has said it is aware of the situation but has not commented on whether it will conduct its own review. Meanwhile, Bangladesh Bank criticized the New York Fed in the incident report, which surfaced on Tuesday but was dated March 13. The report said that the New York Fed allowed five of 35 fraudulent payment instructions to go through.  ”We view this as a major lapse,” Bangladesh Bank said in the report, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. In her letter to the New York Fed, Maloney said she wanted to know why the bank treated the 30 transfers differently than the other five.  The Bangladesh Bank interim report also said the bank was considering ”preparing the ground to make a legitimate claim for the loss of funds” against the New York Fed ”through a legal process.” A source at Bangladesh Bank confirmed the authenticity of the report. Bangladesh police and forensics experts hired by Bangladesh Bank are still collecting information from its computer systems to determine what happened.

"Apple has once again reiterated its claim that it is technically impossible for it to access encrypted data on iPhones that are running iOS 8 or higher and even if it was possible, it would be apprehensive to perform such an action.

It is “impossible” to access encrypted data on the vast majority of iPhones, Apple has told a US federal judge in a New York court.

In a brief that was filed on Monday night at the request of magistrate judge James Orenstein, the tech giant explained that it lacks the “technical ability” to hack into smartphones that are operating iOS 8 or higher.

Apple said that the request from the US Department of Justice to “perform forensic services” on a device in the custody of the government is not only unfeasible, but also “substantially burdensome”.

“Apple cannot take possession of a password protected device … and extract encrypted user data from that device for the government.”

It stated: “[Apple cannot] take possession of a password protected device … and extract encrypted user data from that device for the government.

“Among the security features in iOS 8 is a feature that prevents anyone without the device’s passcode from accessing the encrypted data. This includes Apple.”

It added that as of October 5th, approximately 90 percent of Apple devices are running iOS 8 or higher – all of these, in effect, cannot be accessed by the company.

This is the latest development in what is an ongoing case between Apple and other tech companies and the government over data encryption.

Interestingly, in this instance, the iPhone in questions is running on a version of iOS 7, which Apple can actually hack.

However, even this isn’t absolute. In the brief it said that its ability to access encrypted data depends on multiple factors, including whether or not the smartphone is in good working order.

The ethics of hacking into a protected device

However, beyond the technical challenges, as well as the associated physical and monetary costs, the request to perform such an action leaves Apple in an uncomfortable position.

It noted that presently there is an “unprecedented level” of public sensitivity over issues that relate to digital security and privacy.

“This is true not only with respect to illegal hacking by criminals but also in the area of government access – both disclosed and covert,” Apple expanded in the document to the US judge.

“Apple has taken a leadership role in the protection of its customer’s personal data against any form of improper access.

“Forcing Apple to extract data in this case, absent clear legal authority to do so, could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand.”

This goes beyond the rule of law, says the government

This case has highlighted the clear divide between what tech companies believe is acceptable and what the US government and its international counterparts consider morally and legally justified.

Speaking last year, James Comey, the seventh director of the FBI, told members of the press that efforts by the likes of Apple and Google to boost privacy features on their devices had left the agency “very concerned”.

He said that that while “no one in this country is beyond the law”, these developments to bolster encryption will allow individuals to bypass the legal system for all sorts of malicious reasons.

“There will come a day … when it will matter a great, great deal to the lives of people of all kinds that we be able to, with judicial authorization, gain access to a kidnapper’s or a terrorist or a criminal’s device,” Mr. Comey said at the time.

“I just want to make sure we have a good conversation in this country before that day comes. I’d hate to have people look at me and say, ‘Well, how come you can’t save this kid,’ ‘how come you can’t do this thing?'”",1
"Highlights from the past seven days in information security include the threat from Locky, the nuisance of Robocalls and another celeb-related iCloud breach.

Welcome to this week’s security review, which includes the Locky threat, the nuisance of Robocalls, another celeb-related iCloud breach and a warning from the FBI that cars are vulnerable to cyberattacks.

Trojan Downloaders on the rise: Don’t let Locky or TeslaCrypt ruin your day

ESET’s Josep Albors and Raphael Labaca Castro revealed that weeks after it first started encrypting victims’ files, the ransomware Locky has been found to be still active. In their article, the experts offered interesting details into this threat, including the attack vector being a typical email with a seemingly routine attachment. However, hidden in it is a Trojan Downloader, typically from the S/TrojanDownloader.Nemucod family.

Robocalls: where is RoboCop?

ESET’s senior research fellow David Harley delivered an insightful piece on robocalls. He explained that the nuisance, in which people receive an automated phone call with a pre-recorded message, is often used by criminals to scam people. It is, for example, common in cons relating to mis-sold payment protection insurance and pensions. One tip in reducing instances of robocalls, which was offered by the expert, includes subscribing to a ‘do not call’ register.

Harry Styles and Kendall Jenner photos leak online after iCloud account breach

Reporting on news that personal photographs of celebs Harry Styles and Kendall Jenner had been leaked online after the One Direction star’s mum’s iCloud account was breached, independent security analyst Graham Cluley reiterated the importance of two-step/two-factor authentication. He said: “The great thing about two-step verification and two-factor authentication is that it can help protect your data, even if your password is stolen by a criminal.”

FBI warn that automobiles are vulnerable to cyberattacks

In partnership with the Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, the FBI delivered a public service announcement in which it highlighted the vulnerabilities of modern cars to cyberattacks. “Modern motor vehicles often include new connected vehicle technologies that aim to provide benefits such as added safety features, improved fuel economy, and greater overall convenience,” it stated. “However, with this increased connectivity, it is important that consumers and manufacturers maintain awareness of potential cybersecurity threats.”

ProtonMail: Encrypted key to a more secure future

Speaking to We Live Security by email, ProtonMail’s CEO, Dr. Andy Yen, said that encryption is “key” to a more secure future. As the online world increasingly becomes the go to place for most things – entertainment, banking, work and communication – the “only viable” way of being secure is through encryption, he stated. In an official company blog, Dr. Yen explained that “the best way to ensure that encryption and privacy rights are not encroached upon is to get the tools into the hands of the public as soon as possible and widely distributing them”.

Google adds transparency to online encryption

Google announced that it had added a new category to its transparency report. The new metric will document the use of HTTPS encryption on all requests sent to its servers – this includes information for its own properties, as well as the top 100 non-Google destinations. Revealing this on the official company blog, Rutledge Chin Feman and Tim Willis, HTTPS evangelists at Google, said: “Implementing encryption is not easy work. But, as more people spend more of their time on the web, it’s an increasingly essential element of online security.”",1
" This is the story of how, in the hyperactive Age of Trump, something that initially appeared to be a major change in policy turned into a  . Early Thursday morning, both political and journalistic antennae shot up when the Treasury Department posted a brief paragraph titled “Publication of    General License. ” Pursuant to last month’s sanctions by the Obama administration on Russia’s intelligence service for interfering in the U. S. election, it said, “certain transactions” with the service, known as the FSB, were to be authorized. At first glance, the notice appeared to be the first step toward lifting   sanctions on Russia, something President Trump has indicated he might want to do as he fashioned a new relationship with Russian President Vladi mir Putin. That interpretation was bolstered when former FSB director Nikolai Kovalyov, now a member of the Russian parliament, called it “the first step on the way leading to cooperation in the war on terror. ” “This shows that actual joint work on establishing an   coalition is about to begin,” Kovalyov told Tass. The Russian news site reported that “U. S. authorities have eased” sanctions against Russia’s FSB.  On Capitol Hill, Sen. John McCain ( .) a strong sanctions supporter, told reporters that his staff was still examining the matter, although the initial read was that it was a “technical fix. ”  [An outburst of violence in Ukraine may be Trump’s first test with Putin]  Rep. Eric Swalwell ( .) a member of the House Intelligence Committee, was far less sure. Instead of punishing Russia for its attacks on “our democracy,” Swalwell said in a statement, Trump “is easing sanctions against its team of hackers, the FSB. ” He called on Congress to “act swiftly to reimpose these sanctions so that those who attack America know there’s a price to pay. ” Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. ( . J.) said that Trump had “inexplicably decided to reward” Russia for bad behavior. “For someone who purports to be the ultimate dealmaker,” Pascrell said in a statement, “this sounds like a raw deal to me. ” Sen. Cory Gardner ( .) chose the moment to announce that he was joining a bipartisan group of sponsors of the “Counteracting Russian Hostilities Act of 2017,” a measure calling for even more sanctions against  Russia. At the White House, press secretary Sean Spicer denied any policy change, saying such tweaks were standard operating procedure. By midafternoon, after failing to respond for hours to media calls asking for an explanation, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control organized a   briefing with a “senior Treasury official,” who, it cautioned, could not be quoted. The official explained that U. S. exports of certain communications technology items, mostly consumer goods such as cellphones, tablets and   encryption software, were and remain legal. In the Russian system, however, the FSB is responsible for processing their import. Sanctions prohibiting any dealings with the FSB  —   which charges a fee for its processing service  —   meant that exports had stopped. U. S. exporters had complained, the official said, so the new administration looked into the matter and decided they had a point. The fix now allows U. S. companies, prohibited from dealing with the FSB in any other way, to pay up to $5, 000 a year in FSB fees so that Russians can buy   cellphones and other consumer items. Other sanctions remain in place. Another way to think about it, said Richard Nephew, a former sanctions coordinator at the State Department, is that the sanctions tweak “permits Americans to get licenses to sell Russians things that protect them from government eavesdropping. . . . This  —   in theory  —   helps Russians get goods that allow them to have encrypted, sensitive conversations away from Russian government prying. ” ",1

Today the world woke up to DNS changing and something called DNSChanger. First we had the excellent news of a major FBI bust, taking down a cyber-ring that had infected about four million computers in 100 countries. The operators of this fraud had used malware called DNSChanger to redirect infected computers to rogue websites. For example, Mr. Consumer would type itunes.com into his web browser but end up somewhere other than itunes.com, namely a website chosen by the crooks who had altered the way Mr. Consumer's computer found its way from site to site. (There are plenty of details in the FBI announcement.)

The crooks generated at least $14 million in ill-gotten gains by redirecting traffic to manipulate online advertising schemes. And Mr. Consumer was not the only person affected. Systems within some large enterprises were affected as well as some government agencies, including NASA. Busting this operation was a big win for the feds: 6 arrests made, a huge botnet taken over by the good guys, numerous bank accounts frozen, and hard drives from more than 100 rogue servers seized. If this action can be followed by a successful prosecution and stiff penalties for those convicted then the risk/reward ratio for cybercrime will be nudged a little closer to ""not worth it.""

The sheer scale of this DNSChanger scam is likely to increase the momentum for technology that makes it harder to subvert DNS for illegal purposes namely DNSSEC, short for DNS Security Extensions. The goal of DNSSEC is to protect the Internet from certain attacks, such as DNS cache poisoning, man-the-middle attacks, and the kind of DNS changing the FBI has so dramatically brought to light.

How disappointing then, to get an email later the same day, also about DNS changing, but this time the DNS changer is the U.S. government itself, acting at the behest of a coalition of interests looking for ways to defeat online piracy of music, movies, and other intellectual property. This state-sponsored DNSChanger is part of the PROTECT IP bill in the Senate, and it's House counterpart, the ""Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)."" These bills would require DNS server operators in the US to replace the correct IP address for a website with an alternate address provided by the Attorney General's office, if the website was ""infringing"". The definition of infringing is distributing illegal copies, counterfeit goods or anti-DRM technology,

While we are all in favor of stopping piracy, messing about with DNS and legalizing state-controlled DNS changing seems like overkill. Furthermore, it is fundamentally incompatible with DNSSEC, a technology that will, if it is allowed to proceed, make many parts of the Internet more resistant to abuse, and expand the possibilities for lawful and profitable business in cyberspace. While the FBI and other law enforcement are working hard to stop the bad guys making millions by infecting our computers and subverting DNS it seems unwise to give private companies the ability to go ahead and change DNS armed only with court orders.

To learn more about this issue read the whitepaper by Paul Vixie and other Internet lunimaries ""Security and Other Technical Concerns Raised by the DNS Filtering Requirements in the PROTECT IP Bill"" (pdf file).

So you browse your favorite restaurant review site and settle on a great Mediterranean restaurant, and “magically” a variety of preferences get fed back to your Facebook profile, to be shared, re-shared and re-shared, ricocheting around the internet to form purportedly value-added experiences elsewhere you visit. That’s great news if you want your preferences bounced around, giving websites and apps information that could possibly provide a more personalized experience wherever you visit. It’s also bad trying to protect maddeningly automatic Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and preference sprawl, all at the speed of light.

There is a macro trend flooding the interwebs that almost EXPECTS users’ information to be fed and cross-fed elsewhere online. When I signed up on pinterest.com, it expected (and indeed required) me to provide Facebook or Twitter logins, so the ooze of my information back and forth begins, in order to give me customized output based on it.

This frictionless sharing can make it devilishly difficult to control personal privacy sprawl. I have a friend who a few years back determined to keep his own identity completely off of the internet. This included no pictures, signing up for mandatory online services using aliases, etc. It was simpler then. Moving forward, my friend will have quite a time as more and more online services move to a 2-factor authentication scheme where users have to provide things like passwords, along with you guessed it Facebook/Twitter logins, which are then linked to everything else.

Aside from the obvious parallel of my friend feeling like he’s being forced to sign up for the Matrix, mostly to volunteer to be invaded by curiously personal floods of advertising, should he have a right to keep his own private life pretty much to himself?

Advertisers, on the other hand, are creatively looking for ways to get in front of more targeted eyeballs than just wide net venues like traditional TV. One of those ways is invading the app world and embedding revenue models into things people are already doing, and monetizing the data. Your data. Well, sort of, really more like a snapshot of someone just like you, aggregatized and sold as a pile of targeted data. My friend would argue that doesn’t seem very anonymous in the traditional sense. And he wouldn’t be alone.

For those who value their own privacy, it’s a tough road ahead. Someone remarked that we are seeing the end of the age of privacy, but at what price? Those who have had experiences with personal information spreading wildly out across the internet to those they don’t know, ala racy tropical vacation pictures involving margaritas and double-dares, know the pain incurred and subsequent reputation damage that can happen firsthand. But what can you do once your data is out there besides change your identity, and possibly lay off the margaritas? Good question, and one that lots of folks will wrestle with as the app sprawl goes wild, taking your information with it, and then trying to get it back.

My colleague Stephen Cobb points out an article showing how a single breached Facebook account became a potential leverage point for scams aimed at the myriad friends that account owner had. This highlights that your security/privacy is only as strong as its weakest link, which might be a close friend who’s not particularly interested in either privacy or security until they get burned, and then you do too.",1
"Just as in past decades when cash drawers and bank vaults were targeted for theft, today’s e-shops and online banks have fallen under the scope of cybercriminals. Their “digital-focus” is just an evolutionary step beyond robbing stagecoaches in the Wild West, and banks in the 20th century.

Black Friday 2017: time to fire up your charge cards and your PC for some online shopping! On second thought, first review the risks, then check your password hygiene and make sure your security solution is up to date.

Have you ever thought about what is going on in your PC while you’re shopping online? Well, at the center of it all are web browsers, which are among the primary targets for cyberattackers. This is due to the high volume of sensitive data that flows through browsers. This is especially true during the holiday shopping period. (Get some quick tips here)

Just as in past decades when cash drawers and bank vaults were targeted for theft, today’s e-shops and online banks have fallen under the scope of cybercriminals. Their “digital-focus” is just an evolutionary step beyond robbing stagecoaches in the Wild West, and banks in the 20th century.

Black Friday – and the holiday shopping season that follows – represents an opportunity for cybercriminals, where time invested yields maximum return on investment. To exploit browser vulnerabilities and capture the holiday plunder, criminals can deploy a number of tools including: code execution exploits in both the browser and browser plug-ins, man in the middle attacks, banking malware, fake Android banking apps and DNS Poisoning.

“Just as in past decades when cash drawers and bank vaults were targeted for theft, today’s e-shops and online banks have fallen under the scope of cybercriminals”

To maintain vital trust relationships with customers, some retailers have responded to these potential attacks by building up cyber-defenses. However, losses of data and revenue are likely to continue to plague online shopping, and in parallel, the security of back offices for brick-and-mortar shops. As a result, retailers and consumers have adopted technologies that include SSL certificates, two-factor authentication, data encryption and equally important but often overlooked – education for employees. Other retailers (though in smaller numbers) have even become early adopters of cryptocurrencies for retail transactions.

Are Cryptocurrencies the future?

While the number of transactions using cryptocurrencies may seem trivial, on the surface they do offer improvements in security over traditional online shopping, enabling a significant reduction in risk to sensitive information transferred during transactions with retailers who often collect considerable amounts of customer data.

However, there is a flip side. Reliably buying and using cryptocurrencies is still challenging for less technically astute users and doing so despite the risks, could expose them to further threats. Looking a little deeper, the majority of users probably never consider acquiring bitcoin until they face having to pay for ransomware encryption keys. And while cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could pave the way for considerably improved security, their adoption remains tightly bound to illicit activities.

There have long been cases of cryptocurrencies being mined secretly and thus illegally, via browsers to access the CPU capacity of users’ machines. This trend has not only grown among full-time cyber criminals: nowadays even popular (and legal) websites like Politifact.com and Showtime have been discovered cryptojacking users’ CPU capacity. Regardless of these difficulties, cryptocurrencies and associated technologies are unlikely to disappear from the commerce landscape.",1
"Somewhere in a small city in south central Russia, a group of men in their twenties have got away with what some are describing as one of the biggest cyber-heists in history.

Somewhere in a small city in south central Russia, a group of men in their twenties have got away with what some are describing as one of the biggest cyber-heists in history.

The gang, which has been dubbed “CyberVor” (“vor” means “thief” in Russian) by security researchers, is thought to be in possession of the largest known haul of stolen internet credentials – 1.2 billion usernames and passwords, together with 542 million email addresses.

And the data has been stolen from some 420,000 different websites.

That’s the astonishing claim being made this week by Milwaukee firm Hold Security, who have used the backdrop of the Black Hat and Def Con conferences taking place in Las Vegas this week to announce their discovery, with a little help from reporters at the New York Times.

And naturally the company isn’t being entirely altruistic with its announcement – it’s also using the opportunity to promote its penetration testing and identity monitoring services. I must admit, how they have gone about things has left a bad taste in my mouth.

Frustratingly, Hold Security isn’t saying what sites have been hacked, or given users any method to determine if their account credentials might have been included in the haul. So quite how the average computer user is supposed to respond to an announcement with such a lack of actionable detail is anybody’s guess.

All the researchers said is that the gang amassed its treasure trove by using botnets to identify websites with SQL injection vulnerabilities, and scooping up their data.

It seems unlikely that all of the websites have been informed of the problem either, considering the number said to have suffered breaches. Hold Security’s founder Alex Holden told the New York Times that websites around the world have been affected, including ones in Russia where the hackers are said to hail from.

“Hackers did not just target U.S. companies, they targeted any website they could get, ranging from Fortune 500 companies to very small websites. And most of these sites are still vulnerable.”

I have no doubt that the scale of the CyberVor hacking gang’s ill-gotten gains will make numerous headlines over the coming days, but what I would rather see is Hold Security share comprehensive details of what it has discovered with the public, and for clear advice to be shared with organisations and individuals on how to avoid becoming victims in future.

Website developers, for instance, should ensure that they have reviewed their code for SQL injection vulnerabilities, as well as other commonly found flaws.

It’s also a shame that Hold Security didn’t work with a service like haveibeenpwned, created by researcher Troy Hunt, that helps users determine if any of their accounts had been compromised. Mind you, the scale of the alleged find might have made that problematical.

For the average man and woman in the street to determinine how best to protect the details they share with third-party websites is tricky.

Whenever you create accounts online you are putting trust in the hands of web developers that they are properly securing your information. The very best you can do is enable additional security measures (such as multi-factor authentication when made available), and ensure that you never reuse the same password nor choose a password that is easy to guess or crack.

Because one thing is clear: The Russian CyberVor gang may or may not be sitting on one of the largest cybercriminal hauls in history, but unless we all work harder to keep our private information safe and secure, this is not going to be the last time that you’re waking up to newspaper headlines of stolen passwords.",1
"Girls Inc. of San Diego County was founded 50 years ago as a local affiliate of the national Girls Inc. The national organization was started as the Girls Club of America more than 150 years ago, to help young women who had migrated from rural communities in search of job opportunities.

As you may recall, this summer we introduced a Nonprofit Pitch Fest in celebration of ESET’s 30th anniversary. Unsurprisingly, we heard from a lot of incredible organizations that are doing excellent work to help our community. You’ll be hearing about more of these organizations in the future, as this has introduced us to a lot of interesting outreach programs. In this post, we’ll focus on the Grand Prize winner: Girls Inc. of San Diego County.

About Girls Inc.

Girls Inc. of San Diego County was founded 50 years ago as a local affiliate of the national Girls Inc. The national organization was started as the Girls Club of America more than 150 years ago, to help young women who had migrated from rural communities in search of job opportunities. They continue this tradition today; helping girls get support to find a rewarding career, such as in science and technology industries.

The network of local nonprofit organizations that comprise Girls Inc. reaches more than 140,000 girls annually, at 1,400 sites in 400 cities across the US and Canada. They serve girls from all walks of life and backgrounds. Many Girls Inc. participants are considered “at risk” through no fault of their own, due to circumstances such as family poverty, exposure to gang-dominated environments and even homelessness. More than 83% belong to minorities and 73% come from families with an annual household income of $25,000 or less.

Girls Inc. of San Diego County has inspired girls to be strong, smart and bold through workshops and training in technical skills. Their research-based programs focus on a variety of areas intended to help girls be prepared and successful in whatever career they ultimately choose. Trained mentoring professionals help equip girls to achieve academically; lead healthy and physically active lives; manage money; navigate media messages; and discover an interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

Their organization will be using the funds from ESET to support outreach programs in San Diego that inspire girls to pursue professions in science, technology, engineering and math, and give them opportunities to learn technical skills, like coding, that can lead to jobs in cybersecurity and related fields.

“At Girls Inc. of San Diego County, we are training the next generation of cyber-defenders,” said Carla Vallone, President, Board of Trustees, Girls Inc. of San Diego County. “Our trainees don’t look like the current cybersecurity workforce. Our trainees are girls ages 8 to 18, many of whom are girls of color from diverse backgrounds. We are grateful to ESET for this essential funding that will support our STEM outreach programs here in San Diego County.”

“Ultimately, Girls Inc. really stood out for the work it is doing to inspire young women to be strong, smart and confident while teaching them technical skills,” said Celeste Blodgett, Vice President of Human Resources and Learning and Development at ESET North America. “Its submission laid out very specific ways it will address the cybersecurity skills gap problem, while also helping with diversity in the tech sector.”

By giving support, encouragement and resources to girls who might otherwise not be introduced to the possibility of a career in STEM, we can help improve the future for all of us. We’re grateful for the opportunity to support organizations like Girls Inc. of San Diego County as they work in partnership with schools and communities to help address the unique environmental challenges faced by girls and young women.",1
"…The NYT article strikes me as being well-researched, well-written, and well worth reading, and the involvement of Dimona is more plausible than much of the speculation I’ve seen, but it’s still hard to distinguish hard fact from sheer guesswork…

[Updated 21st January because when going back to check on something I'd said here, I noticed that I'd had a slip of concentration and said something so stupid, I'm not going to tell you what it was. ;-)]

It was to be expected that there'd be a lot of media interest following the New York Times story I previously mentioned here.

And sure enough, I've been able to add several more items to the Stuxnet Information and Resources blog. There is commentary from Heise and from John Leyden in The Register:

My colleague Josep Albors gave me three links from the Spanish press as well as quoting me at length in his own blog (also in Spanish).

He says (excuse the free translation) that:

""Stuxnet is still making news half a year after the first reports to make its existence public knowledge. Now, a comprehensive article in the New York Times attempts to prove the theory that this advanced malicious code was developed by the Governments of Israel and United States in order to delay Iran's planned production of enriched uranium. The articlesuggest that the Israeli nuclear complex at Dimona tested this sophisticated malware against similar centrifuges to those employed in Iran, as a check of Stuxnet's effectiveness.""

""According to this information, plans to launch a cyber-attack to impede Iran's nuclear progress have their origin in 2008, when George Bush's administration was still in command of the United States.""

But, like John Leyden, Josep is a little more sceptical than some of the media. And I think they're right.

The NYT article strikes me as being well-researched, well-written, and well worth reading, and the involvement of Dimona is more plausible than much of the speculation I've seen, but it's still hard to distinguish hard fact from sheer guesswork, which is why I'm more comfortable with the data we've been able to determine from the code, and that's what ESET researchers have focused on in our own writing on the topic.

The assertion that ""Israeli officials grin widely when asked about its effects"" and Samore's ""sidestepping"" of a Stuxnet question are flimsy foundations for assuming the truth of these assertions, though there are other indications that might be more convincing. On the other hand, this ""nudge, nudge, wink, wink"" hinting at US/Israeli collaboration might actually explain an anomaly I've mentioned before. Stuxnet has the hallmarks of a collaboration between several individuals or groups with specialist expertise, yet it's cover was blown by its promiscuous dissemination through the Autorun-like LNK vulnerability, a vector that automatically raises its chances of being detected heuristically.

That suggests to me:

A team where no-one had specific experience in the malware field (maybe that's understandable in a team put together under the auspices of a government or governments).

The malware had already been so effective that staying under the radar wasn't a major concern (the LNK version of Stuxnet was not the first version).

Someone intended to send a message to Iran and the rest of the world about the capabilities of certain agencies and states. After all, much has been made of the ""clues"" in the code. However, I haven't seen conclusive proof that it was the US and/or Israel that orchestrated that message, or planted those clues. If either of those nations are really hinting that they did, that doesn't make it so: misdirection is a standard tool for diplomats and politicians, as well as for spooks.

" The ”sell in May” memo arrived a bit late in some investors’ inboxes this year. A technology sector rout extended to its second trading day on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite on track for its biggest   loss since September. The tech selling dragged down all three major indexes, causing concerns of wider bearishness in equities.  ”We’re having a hard time deciding whether it’s really a     or if this is a valuation pullback, so we’re just holding pat right now,” said Scott Goginsky, a   manager of the Biondo Growth Fund.  However, investors took comfort that rather than totally abandoning equities, some were rotating into value sectors of the market. Losses were contained by a continuing rebound in energy and bank stocks.  ”The overall equity market health is reasonably good because people are rotating   they are not frantically getting out of stocks,” said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co.  Up nearly 14 percent since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, the technology sector of the S&P 500 . SPLRCT had ballooned to its most expensive since early 2008 in terms of price to earnings expectations. Tech took over the market leadership from financials and other sectors that outperformed after the Nov. 8 presidential election on hopes that Trump’s agenda of deregulation and tax cuts would benefit the sector. The five largest U. S. companies by market capitalization, Apple ( ) Alphabet ( ) Microsoft ( ) Amazon ( ) and Facebook ( ) added more than $600 billion in market cap in 2017 before the   started, making some analysts wary of sector  . The Technology Select Sector SPDR   fund ( ) was down 0. 8 percent Monday after having fallen as much as 2. 2 percent   on track to post its largest   percentage decline in nearly a year. The decline was led by Apple, stung by a broker downgrade for a second straight week on Monday.  Short sellers had already been building their position in Apple since the end of May, according to financial data firm S3, with short interest topping $9 billion for the first time since May of last year. Apple is now the   worldwide short, behind Alibaba Group ( ) with $16. 7 billion of short interest, and Tesla Inc( ) with $10. 5 billion. The tech   ”is a reminder that markets that have full valuations are prone to quick reversals,” said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, which oversees more than $1. 5 trillion in assets. The recent reversal in technology has given new life to the ”value trade,” in which investors bet on large, undervalued companies and seek dividend payments. The iShares S&P 500 value ETF ( ) is up more than 4 percent over the last two sessions. The fund’s top holdings include Exxon Mobil ( ) Berkshire Hathaway ( ) and JPMorgan ( ). At the same time, the technology rout has left some investors finding opportunities to add to their tech holdings at lower prices. ”We’re not worried at all about tech. We just think it’s a correction and a dip,” said Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of Navellier & Associates  in Reno, Nevada. ”Guys like me are net buyers right now  …     It’ll be fine.”  (Additional reporting by Megan Davies, Caroline Valetkevich, Jennifer Ablan, Trevor Hunnicutt and David Randall; editing by Megan Davies and Dan Grebler) SEOUL Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  is expected to report its   quarterly profit in the second quarter, with soaring memory chip sales pushing it past Intel Corp  as the biggest semiconductor maker by revenue for the first time.

" Phonemakers are piling in to fill a gap in the market left by Samsung ( ) still licking its wounds from a costly recall of its flagship Note 7 and with no key device of its own to launch at the telecom industry’s biggest annual fair. China’s Huawei [HWT. UL] the most likely contender to fill the hole in the premium end of the market, took the wraps off a new phone in its quest to displace Samsung as the world’s no. 2 smartphone maker after Apple ( ) during a rush of new product releases on Sunday ahead of this week’s World Mobile Congress. Chinese challengers Xiaomi [XTC. UL] Vivo, Oppo and Gionee are in hot pursuit, while BlackBerry ( ) and Nokia ( ) announced models exploiting their retro appeal. Samsung itself presented two new tablets pending the launch of its next flagship device, the Galaxy S8, expected now at the end of March rather than at Mobile World Congress, its usual showcase. ”The past six months have undoubtedly been one of the most challenging periods of our history,” Samsung’s European marketing chief David Lowes told a news conference in Barcelona. ”We’re determined to learn every possible lesson.” Samsung withdrew the Galaxy Note 7 last October after faulty batteries led some devices to catch fire, leading to a loss of consumer trust, wiping out more than $5 billion of operating profit, and allowing the iPhone to overtake it in sales. ”The competition is feisty but I think we have a good chance,” Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei’s consumer business group, told Reuters in an interview. Samsung’s smartphone market share dropped to 17. 7 percent in the fourth quarter, while Apple’s rose to 17. 8 percent, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics.  Independent research analyst Richard Windsor of Radio Free Mobile doubts whether Samsung can quickly regain its position.    ”Samsung has taken a massive $5. 4 billion hit to profits, apologized profusely for the recall and admitted shortcomings in its quality and assurance process but I don’t think that the full effects of this issue have fully hit home,” he wrote in a blog post.    He pointed to a survey from Harris Poll which shows that Samsung’s reputation has fallen from No. 7 in the United States to No. 42, just one position above the U. S. Postal Service. Huawei has aggressively expanded its   to   phones and is going head to head in Asia and Europe with Apple and Samsung in the premium phone market. Its new   P10 phone will go on sale from March at 649 euros ($685) in Europe, its key target market, likely ahead of the expected Samsung S8 launch.  Huawei, which made its name as a builder of telecom networks and only entered the phone market this decade, has made no secret of its ambition to be the world’s number two. But fortunes can change rapidly in the smartphone market, with   names in the West pushing established Asian players such as ZTE ( ) LG Electronics ( ) and   >0992. HK> into the second tier. Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi are now the fourth, fifth and   smartphone makers in the world, according to Strategy Analytics, with Sony ( ) number 16, and HTC ( ) in 20th place. ”The long game in smartphones simply is a marketing game,” said Tim Coulling, an analyst at research firm Canalys.

"In July 2012, our virus laboratory came across what we first thought was a new family of malware. The threat spread by infecting Portable Executable or PE files used by Windows, but this malware also infected systems through remote desktop and network shares. After further analysis, we realized we were dealing with a new version

In July 2012, our virus laboratory came across what we first thought was a new family of malware. The threat spread by infecting Portable Executable or PE files used by Windows, but this malware also infected systems through remote desktop and network shares. After further analysis, we realized we were dealing with a new version of a known malware family: Win32/Morto. The author of this malware – which had already infected thousands of hosts – had updated his creation to add file infection capabilities.

Win32/Morto is best known for being a computer worm, that is, a fully-self-contained rogue program that spreads copies of itself. Adding file-infecting code allows the worm to function as a computer virus as well by attaching copies of itself to other programs which can then be used to further spread the infection. This type of evolution is out of the ordinary and it prompted us to dig further in order to understand this malware better. We are presenting the results of our analysis this week at the AVAR conference in HangZhou, China. This blog contains a summary of the key findings presented at the conference.

Our analysis shows that adding file infection capabilities to this malware had a significant impact on the speed at which it spread. The next figure shows the number of detections of this threat over time. We clearly see a sharp increase in detections around July; this is when the malware was updated to start infecting PE files.

Other characteristics of this malware have remained constant across variants. For example, Win32/Morto has been using the DNS infrastructure to receive commands from its operator. The bot will make a DNS TXT request and will decode the received text so as to update its modules. The figure below shows one such DNS TXT response with the encoded string, which contains the update information. The information is encoded using an algorithm close to base64, but with a different alphabet.

The information received by the bot is simply a list of modules to be downloaded, decrypted and executed. During the last four months, we have seen three different modules being used by the bot. One of the modules is an update to the viral code used for maintaining persistence and infecting files, one module is used to spread by exploiting weak passwords in Remote Desktop and the last module is used to launch distributed denial of service attacks and to display advertisements on the infected system.

There are several clues in the malware code that suggest it was written by a native Chinese speaker. For example, the User-Agent string used by the malware advertises the Chinese language. The geographical distribution of this threat also hints as to its origin.

The following figure shows the geographical distribution of Win32/Morto detections. The dark blue color indicates a high proportion of detections while light yellow shows a small proportion of detections. The map shows a significant number of detections through Asia, including Mongolia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and China. This might also indicate where the infection started and continued to spread.

The two main infection vectors of Win32/Morto are through file infection and the exploitation of weak Remote Desktop credentials. We recommend that users use strong passwords and use an up-to-date antivirus solution to help them stay protected from this threat.

Acknowledgment: I would like to acknowledge François Chagnon and Miroslav Babis for their help in analyzing Win32/Morto.",1
"The federal ethics watchdog isn’t the kind of agency that typically airs its positions on Twitter  —   let alone in a snarky tone, with exclamation points. But it’s been an   weird day at the U. S. Office of Government Ethics. It started Wednesday morning, when   Donald Trump took to Twitter to address concerns about his ability to lead the U. S. government while also holding massive business interests around the world. ”While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses,” Trump tweeted, adding that ”legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations” and that he will be leaving his ”great business in total.” What exactly that means remains unclear. But the verified Twitter account of the typically decorous federal ethics office chimed in with statements that appeared to goad Trump about divesting his businesses  —   something he hasn’t specifically promised to do. ”Bravo! Only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is to divest . Good call!” the agency tweeted, mimicking Trump’s own tweeting style. And: ”OGE is delighted that you’ve decided to divest your businesses. Right decision!” And then things kept getting weirder. All of the tweets disappeared. Twitter erupted in confusion. Observers were suggesting this was a hack or the work of a rogue employee, as The Washington Post posited: ”Maybe the OGE has inadvertently leaked that Trump intends to sell off his assets, a dramatic move that the   may have intended to save for his ’major news conference’ Dec. 15. Maybe the tweets are a hacker’s   joke. Or maybe an OGE official went rogue with the agency’s   accounts, as a way to sarcastically poke at Trump or, having misread the news, cheer him on.” But then, some hours later, the tweets returned  —     all over again, sending a new wave of confusion. An OGE spokesman, Seth Jaffe, who is the chief of the agency’s ethics law and policy branch, emailed a statement to NPR: ”Like everyone else, we were excited this morning to read the  ’s twitter feed indicating that he wants to be free of conflicts of interest. OGE applauds that goal, which is consistent with an opinion OGE issued in 1983. Divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not. We don’t know the details of their plan, but we are willing and eager to help them with it.” The statement suggested that the tweets have been deliberate all along. And, in fact, the OGE later confirmed to NPR that this was not a hack. A few things remained a mystery, among them: Did the OGE know something about Trump’s plans that he hasn’t made public? As NPR’s Scott Detrow has reported: ”Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump promised to turn the Trump Organization over to three of his children. But Don Jr. Eric and Ivanka Trump all remain close political advisers and members of his transition team, so it’s hard to see how the Trump Organization and the Trump administration would remain separate, if that remains the case.” Almost two hours after the first statement, the OGE issued another one: ”The tweets that OGE posted today were responding only to the public statement that the   made on his Twitter feed about his plans regarding conflicts of interest. OGE’s tweets were not based on any information about the  ’s plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed. OGE is   and does not endorse any individual.” The agency’s officials still haven’t answered why the tweets  —   if they were deliberate  —   initially were deleted. And more fundamentally, why did the usually straitlaced OGE decide to break character and publicly vocalize its opinion? Perhaps it’s part of a new,   era of governing and social media. Big league!",1
"Recently, here at our research lab, we have seen an increase in the number of JS/Chromex.Submelius threats detected, says Camilo Gutiérrez Amaya.

Recently, here at our research lab, we have seen an increase in the number of JS/Chromex.Submelius threats detected. In countries like Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Chile, the detection levels for this particular threat have been as high as 30% or 40% of the total threats for the entire country.

This is a trojan that redirects the user’s browser to a specific URL, which contains another kind of malicious content. Given the high detection levels for this threat, which primarily targets Chrome, currently one of the most popular web browsers, we set out to find out how the threat is being propagated and how a user might fall into its trap.

Watch whatever you want … but get infected at the same time

We found one example of how this threat is being propagated on a popular website for watching movies online. In one of the options for watching the content, when the user starts playing a movie, an additional window opens in the browser:

Anyone who has ever visited this kind of website will find nothing particularly unusual about this, as new windows often pop up saying things like “a virus has been detected” or “earn money by working from home”. In this case though, the browser does not redirect to another page with an ad as usual, but goes to a website which then asks you to go to another URL … and the message won’t stop appearing until you click “Accept”.

This new redirection points to a download of an extension from the Chrome web store. The following screenshot shows what the browser’s address bar looks like before the extension is installed:

If the user accepts the download, a space appears next to the address bar with the extension icon, and, if you click on it, it takes you to a new page within the Chrome web store for a different extension. In this case, as you can see in the following screenshot, there are some recent comments saying the app is useless:

If the movie has started playing by this point, the user’s browser will have been infected. If we go and look at what extensions are installed in the browser, we find the one that was downloaded first, and we see that its permissions include reading and changing all your data on the websites that you visit. This leaves an open window so that when the user visits any website some code is injected into it:

Then, while compromised users are browsing the internet, they will suddenly see new windows opening up with information about their systems, taking them to other websites containing downloads of malicious code, advertising, or other kinds of content. This becomes an endless loop, which ultimately will benefit whomever is behind the fraudulent extension.

What can you do if you have downloaded the extension?

If you have downloaded this malicious extension you should remove it immediately from your Chrome browser. To do so, you can type “chrome://extensions” in the address bar and then, when you find the extension, simply delete it.

As a further precaution, you should also analyze your computer or device using a trustworthy security solution to rule out the possibility of having downloaded any other kind of threat to your machine.

As always, it is very important to be careful before clicking on anything and pay close attention to all websites you visit, especially if they ask you to download extensions. We have already seen other campaigns associated with YouTube, Facebook, and other websites that have worked in similar ways.

So, we can see that this kind of campaign is by no means an isolated case. In fact, there is a whole structure of redirection, which we will look at in more technical detail in a future article.

" President Obama has ordered a “full review” of Russian hacking during the November election, as pressure from Congress has grown for greater public understanding of exactly what Moscow did to interfere in the electoral process. “We may have crossed into a new threshold, and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some   to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned,” Obama’s counterterrorism and   adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. Obama wants the report before he leaves office on Jan. 20, Monaco said. On Oct. 7, the intelligence community officially accused Moscow of seeking to interfere in the election through the hacking of “political organizations. ” Though the statement never specified which party, it was clear officials were referring to   into the computers of the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic Party groups. Hacked emails that were damaging to the party and its presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, soon after appeared on websites such as WikiLeaks. The   statement said such leaks were “consistent” with the methods and motivations of   efforts. “We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s   officials could have authorized these activities,” the statement said.     The Post’s Ellen Nakashima goes over the events, and discusses the two hacker groups responsible. (Jhaan   Washington Post)    Seven Democratic senators last week asked Obama to declassify more details about the intrusions and why officials believe the Kremlin was behind the operation. And this week, top Democratic lawmakers in the House sent a letter to Obama urging briefings on Russian interference in the election. Leading Senate Republicans say they are preparing to launch a   probe into Russia’s meddling in the election and into potential cyberthreats to the military.  U. S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies had already been probing what they see as a broad covert Russian operation to sow distrust in the presidential election process. It was their briefings of senior lawmakers that led a number of them to press for more information to be made public.  Monaco said Obama has directed the intelligence community to capture “lessons learned and report to a range of stakeholders,” including lawmakers. She did not commit to making the report public. She noted the increase in malicious   in recent years. Russia has overtaken China as the country of primary concern in the cyberthreat space, intelligence officials have said.      Sen. Lindsey Graham ( . C.) says he wants to investigate whether Russia interfered with the 2016 U. S. election, amongst claims that Donald Trump’s rhetoric on Russia and Vladimir Putin is too soft. (Peter   Washington Post)   Though Russia has long conducted cyberspying on U. S. agencies, companies and organizations, this presidential campaign marks the first time Russia has attempted through cyber means to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election, the officials said. The review comes as   Donald Trump has again dismissed the intelligence community’s findings about Russian hacking and meddling. “I don’t believe they interfered” in the election, he told Time magazine this week. The hacking, he said, “could be Russia. It could be China. And it could be some guy in New Jersey. ” Rep. Adam Schiff ( .) the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Friday, “Given   Trump’s disturbing refusal to listen to our intelligence community and accept that the hacking was orchestrated by the Kremlin, there is an added urgency to the need for a thorough review before President Obama leaves office next month. ”     ",1
"Details of 40 million customer debit and credit cards may have leaked in a data breach at American retailer Target – which began on November 27 and ended on December 15, affecting stores at the height of shopping season.

Details of 40 million customer debit and credit cards may have leaked in a data breach at Target – which began on November 27 and ended on December 15.

“Approximately 40 million credit and debit card accounts may have been impacted between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15, 2013,” the retailer said in a statement. The data stolen is reportedly “track data” which can be used to clone cards, according to Brian Krebs.

“Target alerted authorities and financial institutions immediately after it was made aware of the unauthorized access, and is putting all appropriate resources behind these efforts. Among other actions, Target is partnering with a leading third-party forensics firm to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident.”

The story initially broke via security expert Brian Krebs’ site, Krebs on Security, leaked to him via officials at 10 credit card issuers.

It’s still unclear which stores were affected, and who the attackers are. Krebs quotes one unnamed anti-fraud analyst at a card issuer as saying, “We can’t say for sure that all stores were impacted, but we do see customers all over the U.S. that were victimized.”

According to ABC News, the U.S. secret service is currently investigating, but declined to provide further details. The report said that the attack hit the height of the shopping season, and described it as “one of the largest data breaches of all time”. ABC’s report said that unnamed security experts did not expect the incident to be resolved until “well into the new year.”

The data stolen was “track data”, according to Krebs’ sources. This, Krebs warns, is exactly what cybercriminals need to clone credit cards – but the damage caused by the breach may depend on whether the criminals also have access to PIN numbers.

“The type of data stolen — also known as “track data” — allows crooks to create counterfeit cards by encoding the information onto any card with a magnetic stripe. If the thieves also were able to intercept PIN data for debit transactions, they would theoretically be able to reproduce stolen debit cards and use them to withdraw cash from ATMs,” Krebs said.

ESET Senior Research Fellow David Harley warns that even if the criminals do not have access to this data, the security of Target customers will be impacted.

Harley says, “Even if your PIN or password is well chosen, your security is reduced – not necessarily completely compromised – if data such as track data are compromised by other means.”

“It’s not clear exactly how the data were stolen in this case, and therefore whether PIN data for debit cards were also stolen. Still, it’s always worth trying to make it harder for a crook to guess PINs: the PINs people actually tend to use are more stereotyped than you might think. See this blog for more details.

The store issued a statement via its website, saying, “Your trust is a top priority for Target, and we deeply regret the inconvenience this may cause. The privacy and protection of our guests’ information is a matter we take very seriously and we have worked swiftly to resolve the incident.”

“You should remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or suspect fraud, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions.”

As ESET security researcher Stephen Cobb points out, even though we are hearing that Target’s online shoppers are not affected, now would be a good time for anyone who has an account at target.com to change their password, just to be on the safe side.",1
"It is us, the nerdy geeks who are into computers, who have a moral right to help the great unwashed, and lead them into a bright new future without Windows XP.

Sting famously sang “If you love someone, set them free.”

Here’s my suggested improvement: “If you love someone, upgrade them from XP.”

It’s not actually such an odd connection to make. Way back in October 2001, Sting gave a free concert in New York’s Bryant Park to “celebrate the launch of Microsoft Windows XP”.

Don’t believe me? Here’s the press release, and a photo of the lute-playing Geordie in action at the event:

Why am I singing variations on songs by the former lead singer of The Police?

Well, today is the last day that Microsoft will be publishing security patches for Windows XP.

That’s clearly bad news for computer users who are still using the ageing operating system, as there is no doubt that malicious hackers will attempt to exploit the millions of vulnerable PCs out there.

And that’s why we’re calling on you to help.

Chances are, if you’re reading We Live Security, that you’re a tech-savvy computer user with a healthy interest in information security. Maybe you actually work in an IT department, or are responsible for keeping the computers in your home or office safe-and-sound from malware attacks.

And, if you’re regularly reading We Live Security, you will have seen plenty of warnings about the upcoming demise of Windows XP support and – hopefully – have taken steps and measures to ensure that computers under your care will not be affected.

Seeing as Microsoft first announced the end-of-life for Windows XP way back in 2007, it’s hard for anyone to complain that they haven’t been given enough time to sort something out.

However, there are millions of computer users out there who are blissfully ignorant of the XP cut-off date. They may not even know if they have Windows XP installed or a different versions of Windows (if that’s the case, here’s a helpful website which can tell you in the blink of an eye).

And I believe that it us, the nerdy geeks who are into computers and follow the security news, who have a moral right to help the great unwashed.

If you have friends or family who you suspect might be using a creaky old version of Windows, which might be XP, then now is the time to pay them a visit and offer them a helping hand.

Chances are that your Aunty Hilda doesn’t know how to upgrade to a more modern version of Windows, or is frightened of making a mistake, and they could do with the support of someone friendly to help them make the switch.

And, if their computer is too old or doesn’t have powerful enough hardware to run a more modern version of Windows, don’t forget there are alternatives out there.

Maybe now would be a good time to switch to an alternative operating system such as one running a flavour of Unix (I realise that’s not a great option for many users, and may terrify them more than visiting the shops to buy a newer PC).

Alternatively, if they find some spare cash down the back of the sofa and have been seen gazing longingly at Apple’s trendy gadgets, maybe they would be open to splashing out on an Apple MacBook or iMac?

The important thing is for users to switch from Windows XP as soon as possible, before their computers are attacked and compromised.

The first step is to raise awareness of the issue. You can do that this weekend by paying them a visit, and offering to take a quick look at their PC for them.

The next step is to do something about it. Again, you can help to advise on what the best steps for that particular individual is.

But, whatever you do, don’t leave your friend or family member in the lurch when it comes to XP. Be a decent net citizen and lend them a helping hand, at what could be – for many – a baffling time of change and adjustment.

"Highlights from the past seven days in information security include the state of security in companies in the EMEA region and advice on support scams.

Welcome to this week’s security review, which includes a detailed report from ESET on the state of information security in companies in the EMEA region, helpful advice on support scams and the rise of Android ransomware.

The state of information security in companies in the EMEA region

For this extensive report, ESET spoke to 1,700 experts and managers about the state of information security in companies that operate in the EMEA region. The paper found that malware infection is reported as the most frequent security incident (59% of respondents), followed by social engineering, scams fraud and phishing. Interestingly, it was found that most (98%) have invested in at least one cybersecurity solution.

Support scams: What do I do now?

ESET’s David Harley returned to the question of what to do once a scammer has gained a foothold in your system. “There is no single clear-cut answer to that question,” he remarked. “[This is] because there is no single ‘support scam’ …” In terms of what you can do, the expert offered some solutions, highlighting the fact that it’s a “question best answered on a case-by-case basis”.

The rise of Android ransomware

Ransomware attacks aimed specifically at Android platforms are on the rise, a collaborative effort by ESET’s Robert Lipovsky, Lukas Stefanko and Gabriel Branisa revealed in a white paper. They explained that it is part of a wider trend, whereby cybercriminals are focusing their efforts on mobile devices. With more data being stored on these devices, they are a lot more lucrative, the authors highlighted.

How is cryptography incorporated into PoS terminals?

ESET’s Lucas Paus discussed the different types of cryptographic solutions available to PoS (Point of Sale) terminals. “In payment terminals, largely speaking, there are three groups of cryptographic algorithms that are used in a variety of technologies, where they are combined with each other and with various types of architecture inside PoS devices,” he said. These are symmetric-key algorithms, asymmetric-key algorithms and one-way hash algorithms.

VTech warns users that sensitive information ‘may not be secure’

VTech, which suffered a major data breach towards the end of 2015, announced that its online service Learning Lodge – which was specifically attacked – is now back online. However, what most media outlets picked up on was the interesting update to its terms and conditions. The company’s Limitation of Liability section now states that customers agree that “any information [they] send or receive during [their] use of the site may not be secure and may be intercepted or later acquired by unauthorized parties”.

How to bypass this LG smartphone’s fingerprint security in just 30 seconds

The independent security analyst Graham Cluley drew attention to a “troubling vulnerability” on LG’s V10, which makes it possible for someone to gain access the smartphone easily. “Normally, to add a fingerprint to the phone, you would have to enter a security PIN to prove that you are authorised to do so,” he explained. “However [through the] Nova Launcher app [you can]gain access to the fingerprint screen without any need [for authentication]”.

Major vulnerability found in GNU C Library

Researchers at Google announced that they had comes across a major vulnerability in GNU C Library (glibc), which has been present since 2008. The bug puts hundreds of thousands of devices and apps at risk, the tech company stated. The full implications of this flaw are yet to be understood, but the fact that it was found in the so-called building blocks of the internet is nevertheless troubling. A patch has since been released.",1
"Apple has bowed to pressure from the regime in Beijing, and removed some VPN apps from the Chinese version of its iOS App Store.

Regular readers of We Live Security will know that we have long been proponents of internet users protecting their privacy by installing a VPN on their computers, tablets, and smartphones.

Don’t know what a VPN is? Watch this video from ESET.

Ok, so hopefully we’re all up to speed and understand the importance of running a VPN.

But depending on where you are in the world, things may not be so easy.

For instance, this weekend it has come to light that Apple has bowed to pressure from the regime in Beijing, and removed some VPN apps from the Chinese version of its iOS App Store.

In a blog post, ExpressVPN describes how it received a notification from Apple that its iOS app was being removed from the China App Store.

In the email, Apple explained that the ExpressVPN app was being removed from the China App Store “because it contains content that is illegal in China.”

And it doesn’t seem that ExpressVPN was being specifically targeted. Other VPN apps, such as Star VPN, also revealed that it had been similarly thrown out of the Chinese iOS App Store, and warned that the move set a “very dangerous precedent which can lead to same moves in countries like UAE etc. where government control access to internet.”

Certainly VPN software has been unpopular with the Chinese regime, which views their usage as a tool by which citizens might attempt to skirt around the infamous “Great firewall of China”, used to censor websites and content deemed inappropriate.

Of course, this is one of the concerns – that authoritarian regimes might use the lack of availability of VPN technology to more easily monitor and censor what people are accessing on the internet, and snoop upon private communications.

But they’re not the only group which can exploit weak online security. Criminal hackers can also take advantage of people not using VPNs to spy upon those using insecure Wi-Fi hotspots, and launch man-in-the-middle attacks.

Things perhaps become even more critical if you are business operating in China, which has security standards which require the usage of VPNs to connect to offices remotely, and reduce the chances of sensitive information falling into the wrong hands.

Now, there may be some who will be upset that Apple has caved in to China’s demands, and removed VPNs from its app store. But consider this – what else could they do? It’s well within Chinese power to revoke Apple’s rights to sell products into the country entirely – and the technology company has a long-standing regulation that all apps must conform to the local laws of territories into which they are being sold.

In short, this isn’t really Apple’s fault – it’s China’s.

Fortunately, ExpressVPN has noted that the removal of the VPN apps does not necessarily mean that it’s now impossible to download a VPN onto your iPhone or iPad if you are located in China. Presently, it appears, you will still be able to download a VPN app for your iOS device if you happen to be able to access another country’s iOS App Store:

“Users in China accessing a different territory’s App Store (i.e. they have indicated their billing address to be outside of China) are not impacted; they can download the iOS app and continue to receive updates as before.”

Of course, that’s unlikely to be an option that most of the population of China will be able to take up.

Thank goodness then that for now, at least, VPN apps running on the Windows, Mac, and Android platforms still appear to be available for Chinese users to download.

Provided, of course, that China’s internet firewall doesn’t prevent you from accessing their download sites in the first place…",1
" (CNN) An attorney for Aaron Hernandez’s estate expects to sue state officials for negligence surrounding his apparent suicide and railed against the ”salacious” details leaked to the media, he said in court on Friday. George Leontire, an attorney representing Hernandez’s family, filed a bill of discovery in Bristol County Superior Court calling on Massachusetts officials to preserve all evidence in the investigation into Hernandez’s death. That evidence is relevant to potential legal action for negligent supervision related to the custody of Hernandez, Leontire said. Judge Thomas McGuire Jr. ruled that the state must preserve video of his cell, his clothes, photos of his body and all phone calls for 30 days prior to his death, among other pieces of evidence. Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end, hanged himself by a bedsheet in his prison cell early Wednesday, according to the Department of Corrections. Investigators ruled that his death was a suicide by asphyxiation, and said that three handwritten notes were found in the cell next to a Bible. A failure to communicate, Leontire slammed the state’s lack of communication with the Hernandez family as well as the ”salacious” leaks to media outlets. ”We have not been told any of the circumstances around his death. We have to read it on Twitter and in the news,” he said.  ”Frankly, I think it violates every code of decency.” In particular, Leontire said the family does not know what was on three handwritten notes found in Hernandez’s cell. He also said he had not heard from officials whether Hernandez had the biblical reference ”John 3:16” written on him, as a law enforcement source involved in the investigation told CNN. ”We read in a press release that there were suicide notes. No one has called us about those suicide notes. We don’t know what those notes say,” he said. That press release from Worcester County district attorney’s office said there was no check on Hernandez’s cell between 8 p. m. and 3:03 a. m. If true, Leontire said, that would be a ”extraordinary violation” of procedure. The complaint was filed on behalf of Hernandez’s fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins Hernandez, and his    daughter, Avielle. The defendants are listed as Thomas Turco, the commissioner of Department of Corrections, Daniel Bennett, the secretary of Public Safety, and Steven Silva, the superintendent of the   Correctional Center. Hernandez had been serving a sentence of life without parole for the June 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd, the boyfriend of his fiancee’s sister. Hernandez’s death came less than a week after he was acquitted of two murder charges for the July 2012 killing of two men outside a Boston nightclub. Lloyd’s mother speaks out, Earlier on Friday, Lloyd’s mother, Ursula Ward, and her attorney, Doug Sheff, said they were moving ahead with a civil suit against Hernandez’s estate. Legal experts have said Hernandez’s death complicates the status of that case. Because of a   legal rule called abatement, the murder conviction against Hernandez is expected to be dismissed because his appeal of the conviction had not been heard at the time of his death. Civil suits often rely on a criminal conviction as its basis of facts, so without it, Lloyd’s suit asking for damages could be trickier. However, Sheff said he was ”not concerned” about the issue. Sheff also issued a ”very friendly challenge” to the New England Patriots to voluntarily pay $6 million to Ward’s family as part of that suit. ”That would make the Patriots Ursula Ward’s champion,” he said. Wearing a pin bearing a photo of her son, Ward said she planned to use the money from a civil suit to create a college scholarship fund. ”There’s no amount of money in the world that can bring Odin back,” she said. ”None.”",0
"Melbourne (CNN) Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams, the most successful players at the Australian Open in the Open Era with six titles apiece, were handed difficult starts in Melbourne this year.  Djokovic will play Fernando Verdasco    who let slip five match points against the Serb in the Doha semifinals last week    while fellow world No. 2 Williams begins against Belinda Bencic.  Read: Why the Australian Open stands out, Bencic downed Williams the last time they faced off in 2015 and has only slipped outside the top 15 in the rankings    the Swiss currently sits 48th    due to an array of injuries. Just this week, she was forced to retire in a match at the Sydney International because of a cracked toenail.  The two tantalizing   encounters overshadowed the fate of Roger Federer in Friday’s draw. Federer, competing in a grand slam for the first time since July, has a seemingly simpler task to begin with since he netted a qualifier.  Bencic’s compatriot    they teamed up at last week’s Hopman Cup in Perth    landed in the same half as world No. 1 Andy Murray.  While the   Verdasco can’t match Djokovic’s pedigree, the Spaniard has produced magic in Melbourne in the past thanks largely to his potentially punishing forehand.  Twelve months ago he stunned occasional Davis Cup teammate Rafael Nadal in five sets in the first round and in 2009, Verdasco achieved his lone grand slam semifinal at Melbourne Park. Back then, Nadal    who was arguably in the best spell of his career    needed five sets and five hours to see off Verdasco in a classic.  Djokovic’s spirits have lifted after rallying past Verdasco in Doha and snapping Murray’s   winning streak in the final.  Read: A night with Novak, Williams’ preparations for the season’s first major didn’t go as well.  She committed a staggering 88 unforced errors in a   reverse to fellow American Madison Brengle in Auckland.  And if Williams    bidding for an unprecedented 23rd grand slam title in the Open Era    gets past Bencic she figures to have another difficult tussle in the second round. Lucie Safarova would be her probable foe in a rematch of the 2015 French Open final the American won in three sets.  Like Bencic, Safarova’s slide in the rankings to 62nd can be attributed to health issues. In the Czech’s case, a bacterial infection was to blame.  Federer had for the most part been free of physical issues until undergoing left knee surgery early in 2016 and   the knee in a semifinal loss to Milos Raonic at Wimbledon. He wrapped up his season following Wimbledon to recover and made his long awaited return to tennis at the Hopman Cup.  The inactivity sent his ranking down to 17th, unfamiliar territory for the men’s record   grand slam winner.  Federer vs. Murray? The hugely popular Federer would challenge another qualifier in the second round but his task becomes more difficult thereafter. If the seeds hold, the    draws 10th seed Tomas Berdych in the third round and   Kei Nishikori in the fourth.  Read: Federer refreshed, Should Federer make the quarterfinals, Murray    pitted against Ukraine’s IIlya Marchenko in round one    likely awaits.  The fourth member of the ”Big Four,” Nadal, was paired with Florian Mayer in the first round. But it’s another German, Alexander Zverev, who figures to be Nadal’s first sizable test in the third round. Zverev, 19, rose from 83rd to 24th in the   rankings, held a match point on Nadal in their lone duel in Indian Wells last year, beat Federer in Halle in June and subsequently at the Hopman Cup.   Women’s No. 1 and defending champion Angelique Kerber meets   Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine in the first round, with Daria Kasatkina looming in the fourth round.  Visit cnn.  for more news and videos, Kerber has endured a shaky buildup to the Australian Open, losing to the   Russian in the second round in Sydney. ",0
"Tokyo (CNN) Japan’s Princess Mako is giving up her royal status    all in the name of love. The    is a prince himself . .. of sorts. The Imperial Household tells CNN plans are underway for the    princess, granddaughter of Emperor Akihito, to become engaged to Kei Komuro, also 25, a law firm worker and graduate student who once starred in a tourism campaign as ”Prince of the Sea.” The couple met five years ago as students at the International Christian University in Tokyo, Japan’s national broadcaster NHK reported. It was while in university that Komuro played the ”Prince of the Sea” in a beach tourism campaign for the city of Fujisawa, south of Tokyo. Shrinking imperial family, Japan’s   imperial law requires a princess to leave the imperial family upon marriage to a commoner. The last to do so was Princess Mako’s aunt, Sayako, the only daughter of Emperor Akhito, when she married town planner Yoshiki Kuroda in 2005. The engagement won’t become official until a ceremonial exchange of gifts, but the news has reignited concerns about the shrinking size of the imperial family, which currently has 19 members, 14 of whom are female. Imperial law only allows the throne to be passed to male heirs, of which there are only three: Crown Prince Naruhito, his younger brother Crown Prince Akishino, and Akishino’s son, Prince Hisahito. In addition to Princess Mako, there are six other unmarried princesses    who will also lose their royal status if they marry commoners. That has raised the possibility that the imperial family will not have enough members to continue carrying out its public duties. Future of the monarchy, Last summer,    Emperor Akihito voiced concerns that his advanced age may begin to affect his ability to rule. Akihito said that while he felt he was in good health he was worried about the increasing burden of the role. ”When I consider that my fitness level is gradually declining, I am worried that it may become difficult for me to carry out my duties as the symbol of the State with my whole being as I have done until now,” he said. His announcement followed one from the Imperial Household a few months earlier that he and Empress Michiko, 82, would reduce their public appearances. Imperial law requires an Emperor to serve for life, but Akihito’s announcement put plans into motion for the Japanese parliament to allow the Emperor to step aside should he choose to. The draft bill for the Emperor’s abdication is to be submitted for both the upper and lower houses of parliament this week. What happens if the Japanese Emperor steps down? ’Prince of the Sea’ On Wednesday, Japanese media focused on the man who has stolen Princess Mako’s heart. Journalists camped out in front of the law offices where Kei Komuro works as a paralegal.  Komuro declined to answer questions about the impending engagement, telling reporters, ”I would like to talk about it when the time comes.” Japanese citizens also wanted to find out more about Komuro, flooding the Fujisawa City Ocean Prince website, local media reported. Reactions from the public have so far been generally positive, but some are wondering what the upcoming marriage will mean for the future of the monarchy. ”I personally think a female imperial member should be allowed (to remain in the family),” said Meiko Hirayama, a    employee at an accounting firm. ”I guess the male line of succession would be kept through the crown prince and his brother, but I think there should be no problem that there could be a female emperor someday.” But    Katsuiji Tsunoda insisted the heir to the throne exclusively be male. ”It’s a tradition that has continued for over a thousand years. If we go with the global trend, anyone could be the emperor,” he told CNN. ”We must respect tradition.”",0
" (CNN) Democrats easily defeated Republicans   in the 2017 Congressional Baseball Game, in an annual tradition that has taken on renewed importance in the wake of Wednesday’s shooting in Alexandria, Virginia. One day after a gunman opened fire at a Republican congressional baseball practice, shooting House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and three others, lawmakers took the field Thursday evening at Nationals Park in Washington. The annual Congressional Baseball Game pits Republicans against Democrats, but this year the focus has turned to showing unity in the wake of the shooting. Interest in the charity baseball game has skyrocketed in the aftermath of the shooting, as staffers and lawmakers look to rally around Scalise and the three others who were shot: a congressional staffer, a lobbyist and a Capitol Police special agent. At the end of the game when Democratic manager Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Doyle was presented the winning trophy, he called Republican manager Texas Rep. Joe Barton to join him. Doyle gave the winning trophy back to the Republicans to put in Scalise’s office. There were 24, 959 tickets sold, which was a record for the game that was first played in 1909. More than $1 million has been raised this year for Congressional Sports for Charity. Ivanka Trump, joined by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and her two eldest children Arabella and Joseph Kushner, presented a $50, 000 check from ”Friends in the Trump Administration” to ”Congressional Sports for Charity” at the game.  The game raised about $500, 000 for charity last year, according to spokeswoman Meredith Raimondi. Pushing that message of unity were the House leaders Speaker Paul Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who told CNN’s Jake Tapper on CNN’s ”Erin Burnett OutFront” that despite party affiliation they were both on ”Team Scalise.” Congressional baseball practice shooting: What we know about the victims, Former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre presented the game ball to Capitol Police special agent David Bailey, who came out on the field on crutches after being injured in Wednesday’s shooting, to throw out the first pitch to huge applause. President Donald Trump sent a video message to the game, highlighting Scalise who remains in critical condition on Thursday after several surgeries. ”By playing tonight, you are showing the world that we will not be intimidated by threats, acts of violence, or assaults on our democracy,” Trump said. ”The game will go on.” The Washington Nationals released additional seating in at the stadium to accommodate the demand. Instead of wearing hats representing their home teams, as is the normal tradition, players on both teams wore Louisiana State University hats in honor of Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, for part of the game. Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who was at Wednesday’s practice and gave medical help after the shooting, said it would have ”been awful” if the game had been canceled, and said Scalise would want it to go on. ”I hope he’s in good enough shape to watch, because he’ll certainly feel good about what he sees,” Flake said. ”I was there at the hospital last night, and I hope he’s doing better today. It’s a long road for him.” RELATED: Here’s how to watch the Congressional Baseball Game, Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana was the Democrats’ star pitcher, and a close friend of Scalise’s. The two have enjoyed a   ribbing over the game, which Republicans won last year to break a   Democratic win streak. ”I’ll miss the banter with him back and forth, but I’m sure there’s some substitutes over there I can go pick a fight with,” Richmond told reporters. ”It’ll be a different game without him there.” But Flake said the final score wasn’t likely to matter this year. ”As far as winning and losing, I think that’s far from anybody’s mind right now,” he said.",0
"’Oil began its calamitous slide in   and there’s been a lot of speculation since then about when —  and how quickly —  it will recover. By analyzing past oil cycles and their drivers, we can understand what the signs of a sustainable rally might be.’ ’Learning Lessons from Oil’s Past’ ’Since 1985, there have been six oil crashes where the spot price has fallen by more than 20% measured from peak to trough. But not all oil   are the same: the underlying drivers and macro environment, the path of recovery, oil’s correlation with risk assets, and optimal portfolio exposures can vary.’ ’But we can draw some conclusions from analyzing oil’s history.   generally last longer if they are dominated by supply shocks rather than demand shocks. Oil has also had a low correlation to risk assets in these     and they’re a net positive for subsequent global GDP growth.’ ’Regardless of the specific drivers of troughs and their later recoveries in oil markets, the turning points in these cycles generally have had three signs in common:’ ’1. Investor sentiment and positioning turns positive. When a recovery is at hand, investors’ attitudes and actions usually reflect it. The volatility of   contracts declines, speculators’ positioning begins to favor long exposures, and oil’s spot price gains momentum.’ ’2. The   curve flattens. When “prompt” —  or the closest expiring —    prices are lower than prices further out, that tends to indicate   oversupply concerns   a buildup of oil inventory (assuming there’s an   curve, or “contango,” with the prices of   futures higher than those of   futures; the opposite of this is known as “backwardation”). As investors become more confident that fundamentals are improving (e. g. they expect inventory buildup to slow) the curve tends to flatten.’ ’3. Inventory buildups   inventory drawdown starts. When actual oil inventory declines, or even when it builds up less slowly, that can indicate that   growth is slowing or that demand is improving. This can suggest a turning point in the oil cycle.’ ’Oil’s Current Episode: Largely Supply Driven’ ’Supply factors were the main drivers of the current oil   (2014 —  2016) as OPEC shifted its policy in response to growing US   supply in an environment of fairly robust demand. The   was intensified by a strong US dollar and a    impact from potential geopolitical risks.’ ’Oil’s correlation to risk assets has been low this time around, which is consistent with past supply cycles. But this cycle appears to differ in one respect: stress on commodity producers has surfaced quickly, but the benefit to other parts of the global economy has been more subtle and hasn’t materialized completely yet because of a backdrop of anemic pricing power.’ ’Nevertheless, we believe that the trough and recovery signals above would be effective at indicating a turn in the oil cycle. At this point, investor sentiment and positioning has turned positive, and the   yield curve has flattened since February (Display 1).’ ’’ ’Display 2’ ’’ ’Where Do Investors Go from Here?’ ’We think we’ve seen the bottom in oil prices for this cycle.

" (CNN) At first they look like regular paintings   beautiful, and bursting with talent    but regular nonetheless.  And then, it strikes you that these photographic images are barely larger than your thumbnail.  Lorraine Loots, an artist based in Cape Town, has dedicated her life to making ”paintings for ants” miniatures that measure somewhere between 8 and 30 millimeters, making them smaller than coins or the nib of a pencil.  An hour a day, It all started in 2013, when Loots was pursuing a career beyond art    ”a real job”   as a production manager at photo shoots. ”I didn’t want to stop painting, though, so I constructed this   project where I had to spend an hour a day creating something.”  With a steady hand and an eye for detail, she set forth painting random items that took her fancy every day.  Eventually, the project took over her days and became a   commitment, resulting in a book called 365 Paintings for Ants.  Dedicated to Cape Town, In 2014, to coincide with Cape Town’s designation as World Design Capital, she did it all over again, creating 365 postcards related to her home town in some way    referencing the city’s exotic landscape or one of its native birds.  Each one of her intricate images became viral sensations on Instagram and racked up big sales on Etsy.  This year, she has decided to limit her paintings to just 100, focusing around four different themes    space, books, animals and miscellaneous.  So far, she has created meticulous images of horses, sloths, planets and nebulas, The Great Gatsby and The Hobbit. And Bill Murray, because why not. And, in case you’re wondering, no    she doesn’t use a magnifying glass.  Attention to detail, What defines this type of artistry? ”Selective attention to detail,” says Loots. ”At times, my studio is so chaotic that I need to clear a small space on my desk amidst the pile of papers, paints, plants and figurines just to be able to work, but I’d spend an hour erasing and rewriting a letter that’s a fraction of a millimeter too    .” Her creative process starts with external sources of inspiration: ”I’ll search encyclopedias or the internet for reference pictures   I normally work from about 10 references per painting, as each reference would capture a different specific detail I need.  ”Next, I find the spot with the best light, find something small to fill with water, set up my tools and select a new podcast to listen to.  ”I draw the boundary circle in the middle of one of my   pages, sketch the rough outlines in watercolor pencil and then hack away at it with brushes and watercolor paint until I feel like I’ve captured whatever I’m painting.” Listening to the followers, Because of the nature of the project, there’s not much room for creative block: ”Besides, there’s always something I feel like painting. If I’m really stuck, which rarely happens, I’ll turn to my followers and ask for their suggestions   it makes for a great change of pace.” But having a working routine that must be met every day isn’t always easy: ”I’ve had sick days during which I was only able to drag myself out of the bed for that hour it takes to do the painting, and it’s taken all my willpower.  ”We lost a close family member on the last day of 2013’s project, the day before I was going to take on 2014. That was incredibly hard. Life just goes on and sometimes you have to make big sacrifices if you want to stay committed.” There’s an element of pressure in having to create something for someone every single day: ”But the incredible feedback and the feeling of being one step closer to achieving a much bigger goal is what keeps me going.  ”The reward is huge.” Loots will be exhibiting all her miniatures from 2013 and 2014 at the Three Kings Studio in New York from July 8    15th.  Her paintings are available online on Etsy.",0

"More than a century after Georgetown University used some of the profits from the sale of 272 enslaved   to help ensure its survival, John J. DeGioia, the university’s president, took a first step on Monday toward making amends to their descendants. He walked into the public library in Spokane, Wash. for a private meeting with Patricia   a     of Nace and Biby Butler, two of the slaves who were sold in 1838 to help keep the college afloat. The   meeting, which was followed by a lunch at the nearby Davenport Hotel, may well have been a historic one. More than a dozen universities have recognized their ties to slavery and the slave trade. But historians say they believe this is the first time that the president of an elite university has met with the descendants of slaves who had labored on a college campus or were sold to benefit one. “I came to listen and to learn,” Mr. DeGioia said in an interview, describing the discussion as “moving and inspiring. ” Ms.   an amateur genealogist and retired teacher, said she believed Mr. DeGioia was willing to take necessary steps “to honor the sacrifice and legacy” of her ancestors. “He asked what could he do and how could he help,” she said in an interview. “It was a very good beginning. ” The meeting comes as officials at Georgetown continue to grapple with how to address the college’s complicity in the slave sale. The slaves, who were owned by the Jesuit priests who founded and ran the college, were sold for about $3. 3 million in today’s dollars. A portion of the profit  —   about $500, 000  —   was used to help pay off Georgetown’s debts at a time when the college was struggling financially. The slaves, who had lived on Jesuit estates in Maryland that had helped to finance the college’s operations, were uprooted and shipped to plantations in Louisiana. A working group assembled by Mr. DeGioia in September has been considering whether the university should apologize for profiting from slave labor, create a memorial to those enslaved, or provide scholarships for their descendants, among other possibilities. The report is expected to be released this summer, Mr. DeGioia said. Craig Steven Wilder, a historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied the roots of elite universities in slavery, said he did not know of another instance in which a university president had reached out to descendants. “Georgetown has made a decision to recognize the humanity of the problem they’re dealing with, to treat it as more than a public relations problem,” Mr. Wilder said. The search for descendants of the men, women and children sold in 1838 intensified in the fall after Georgetown students called on the university to remove the names of the Rev. Thomas F. Mulledy and the Rev. William McSherry from two campus buildings. The priests were two of Georgetown’s early presidents. Both were involved in the slave sale. Mr. DeGioia, who had already called for a campuswide discussion about the college’s roots in slavery, agreed to change the names of the buildings. The student protests inspired a Georgetown alumnus, Richard J. Cellini, to found a nonprofit, the Georgetown Memory Project, to help identify and support the descendants of the people who were sold. Mr. Cellini hired eight genealogists, including Ms.   and several researchers who are working with her. University officials are also identifying descendants of the slaves. Ms.   said that she made a point of telling Mr. DeGioia what she knew about her ancestors and emphasizing the importance of the university’s archival records. This year, Georgetown created an online archive that includes records that describe the slave sale and the Jesuit and Louisiana plantations. “These were real people,” Ms.   said of her enslaved forebears, “and I wanted to put faces on them for him. ”",0
"A study in Nature has confirmed what to many    is probably blindingly obvious: far from being traumatised by global warming, plants simply adapt to it. [Here’s the abstract of the study, lead authored by Professor Peter Reich, an ecologist and plant physiologist from the University of Minnesota.  Boreal and temperate trees show strong acclimation of respiration to warming, Plant respiration results in an annual flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere that is six times as large as that due to the emissions from fossil fuel burning, so changes in either will impact future climate. As plant respiration responds positively to temperature, a warming world may result in additional respiratory CO2 release, and hence further atmospheric warming. Plant respiration can acclimate to altered temperatures, however, weakening the positive feedback of plant respiration to rising global air temperature, but a lack of evidence on   (weeks to years) acclimation to climate warming in field settings currently hinders realistic predictions of respiratory release of CO2 under future climatic conditions. Here we demonstrate strong acclimation of leaf respiration to both experimental warming and seasonal temperature variation for juveniles of ten North American tree species growing for several years in forest conditions. Plants grown and measured at 3. 4 °C above ambient temperature increased leaf respiration by an average of 5% compared to plants grown and measured at ambient temperature without acclimation, these increases would have been 23%. Thus, acclimation eliminated 80% of the expected increase in leaf respiration of   plants. Acclimation of leaf respiration per degree temperature change was similar for experimental warming and seasonal temperature variation. Moreover, the observed increase in leaf respiration per degree increase in temperature was less than half as large as the average reported for previous studies, which were conducted largely over shorter time scales in laboratory settings. If such dampening effects of leaf thermal acclimation occur generally, the increase in respiration rates of terrestrial plants in response to climate warming may be less than predicted, and thus may not raise atmospheric CO2 concentrations as much as anticipated. Some previous alarmist studies have suggested that global warming will create a positive feedback loop, whereby plants exposed to more heat will increase their production of carbon dioxide, making the planet even warmer still. If you believe in anthropogenic warming theory, this would indeed be a scary prospect given that plants produce six times more CO2 than humans produce by burning fossil fuels. As the Nature press release puts it: For every 10 degrees Celsius of temperature increase, plants are known to double their rate of metabolism, which has led to fears that global warming will trigger a   loop, switching plants from being a net carbon dioxide sink  —   absorbing more carbon dioxide than they release  —   to becoming a net source of the warming gas. However the study found that this wasn’t the case. They found that 10 types of North American trees, in artificially heated outdoor forest plots, adapted to higher temperatures without drastically boosting the amount of carbon produced by their leaves.  “Plants play less of a role than previously thought in speeding up global warming through accelerated respiratory carbon dioxide emissions,” lead author Peter Reich of the University of Minnesota told an online news conference. “Given the number of plants on Earth this is a big deal,” he said of their role in the carbon cycle. Plants aren’t bothered by warmer weather and adapt to changing conditions.  Who would ever have imagined it?  ",0
"The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) reported that nearly one million immigrants are ignoring a deportation order from an immigration court. Nearly 200, 000 of those are convicted criminals. [“The fact that almost 10 percent of the illegal resident population has already been ordered removed and is still here illustrates just how dysfunctional our immigration enforcement system is. It also should be of great concern that 20 percent of them are convicted criminals, and that most of these are at large in our communities,” CIS Policy Studies Director Jessica Vaughn told the Washington Times’s Stephen Dinan.  Her comments were based on a report released by the CIS on June 30. The report reveals that 925, 193 immigrants have remained in the United States after being ordered to leave the country. Of those, 179, 040 are convict[ed] criminals who were ordered deported. Only 11, 373 of those ordered deported have been detained. Of the 179, 040 convicted criminals who were ordered removed, only 6, 905 are being detained. That leaves 172, 135 convicted criminal aliens roaming the streets after a final order of removal. This number is at the highest lever for the past four report years and represents a 20 percent increase over the 2012 numbers, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement reports obtained by CIS. Vaughn reported the three main reasons why the aliens ordered deported are still in this country. The first reason is the home country of the alien’s refusal to accept their return. Vaughn reported that   countries currently are uncooperative” with ICE efforts to repatriate the individual with their home country.   others are listed as “strained. ” Unfortunately the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that immigrants ordered deported can not be held for more than 180 days except in certain situations. ICE was forced to release 2, 166 aliens from custody in 2015 and a total of more than 6, 100 during the previous two years. The second reason for the aliens remaining illegally in the country after being ordered deported is they simply disappear.  “Former immigration judge Mark Metcalf has analyzed immigration court data and found that more than half of   aliens skip out on their hearings, Vaughn wrote in the report. The third reason listed is sanctuary policies of many cities located across the country. Vaughn reported that dozens of state and local governments have adopted sanctuary policies that obstruct ICE from being able to take deportable aliens into custody. Most notable among these is Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez. This criminal illegal alien was awaiting his sixth deportation after serving time in a federal prison in California. Before he could be deported, San Francisco asked to take custody of the criminal alien on an old drug charge. When that charge was dropped, the sanctuary city of San Francisco ignored the immigration hold order and released him on the public. A few months later, he allegedly shot and killed Kate Steinle in cold blood as she was walking along the San Francisco Pier with her father. Breitbart News has reported extensively on Steinle’s murder and the controversy over the city’s sanctuary policy. Mexico leads the list of both the number of aliens ordered deported and criminal   aliens. 187, 384 of the   aliens are from our neighbor to the south while 67, 792 of the criminal aliens not deported also come from that country. Cubans represent the second largest number of   criminal aliens. A full sixty percent of the nearly one million aliens roaming the country after being ordered deported come from Mexico and the Central American countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.

" (CNN) Remember the Tuskegee syphilis experiment from the 1930s?   Scientists studied poor   in Alabama who’d contracted the venereal disease but didn’t tell them they had the disease or do anything to cure them. A lawsuit filed this week alleges Johns Hopkins University and the Rockefeller Foundation helped conduct a similar study in Guatemala from 1945 to 1956.  Orphans, inmates, psychiatric patients and prostitutes were deliberately infected with sexually transmitted diseases to determine what drugs, including penicillin, worked best in stopping the diseases, the lawsuit says. The subjects of the experiments weren’t told they’d been infected, the lawsuit says, causing some to die and others to pass the disease to their spouses, sexual partners and children.  The suit seeks more than $1 billion in damages and has 774 plaintiffs, including people who were subjects in the experiments and their descendants. This is the second attempt to collect damages. In 2012, a   federal lawsuit was filed against the U. S. government over the Guatemala experiments conducted by the U. S. Public Health Service. A judge dismissed it, saying the Guatemalans could not sue the United States for grievances that happened overseas. The new lawsuit was filed in the Baltimore City Circuit Court. Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller Foundation filed statements on their websites condemning the experiments, but denying responsibility.  ”The plaintiffs’ essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members’ participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself and that therefore Johns Hopkins should be held liable,” the Johns Hopkins statement said. ”Neither assertion is true.” The lawsuit alleges the Rockefeller Foundation funded Johns Hopkins’ research into public health issues, including venereal disease, and employed scientists who monitored the Guatemala experiments.  The lawsuit, the Rockefeller Foundation statement said, ”seeks improperly to assign ’guilt by association’ in the absence of compensation from the United States federal government.”  The suit says Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller Foundation designed, supported and benefited from the Guatemala experiments.   Squibb pharmaceutical group and that company’s owner, Mead Johnson, also are defendants. The pharmaceutical company supplied drugs for the experiments, the suit says.  On Saturday, a spokeswoman for   Squibb sent this statement to CNN: ”We’ve only just received the complaint in this matter.   Squibb played an important role in the development of penicillin in the past and today we continue to focus our work on developing breakthrough medicines for serious disease. As a company dedicated to patients, we take this matter very seriously and are reviewing the allegations.” Nobody doubts the experiments happened. In 2010,   of State Hillary Clinton apologized to Guatemala for the experiments, saying they were ”clearly unethical.”  In the 1930s and 1940s, the government followed a policy of funding scientific medical research but not controlling individual doctors, the suit says. The lawsuit says John Hopkins controlled and influenced the appointed panels that authorized funding for research into venereal disease. The lawsuit says prostitutes were infected to intentionally spread the disease and that syphilis spirochetes were injected into the spinal fluid of subjects. A woman in a psychiatric hospital had gonorrhea pus from a male subject injected into both her eyes, the suit says. The lawsuit doesn’t say why the experiments ended. The results were never published and were not revealed until 2011, when the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues wrote a letter to President Barack Obama telling of its investigation, the suit says.",0
"The sun finally came out after a drenching rain storm in Pennsylvania’s Alleghany Mountain country on the first day of the work week. It marked a symbolic development for the coal miners whose future is brighter thanks to President Donald Trump’s efforts to revive an industry that the Obama administration had promised to all but abolish. [For Joey Kostya, that means he can continue a family tradition.  “My father and my grandfather before me were miners,” Kostya said after emerging from a shaft of the mine that broke ground just recently and was celebrated by Trump with Corsa Coal Corporation officials and other dignitaries overlooking the pit that reveals the rich vein of coal that runs beneath the rolling hills. “I’m absolutely thrilled to be speaking with you on this great, great day,” Trump said via video. “The miners of Pennsylvania are mining coal again. “Washington may be 180 miles down the road, but I want you to know each and every day, I’m fighting for you and all the forgotten men and women of America,” Trump said. Kostya told Breitbart News that he thinks there’s a future in coal now and he’s glad to keep his job working in the mines. “I like everything about it,” Kostya said. “It’s a fun job. ” “Something different every day so it keeps it interesting”  Kostya continued before donning his working gloves again and heading back into the mine. “Under a tent perched hundreds of feet above a freshly dug coal pit, about 200 miners, business leaders, and politicians celebrated amid the surge of enthusiasm for the industry,” the Associated Press reported on “opening day. ” “Mining headgear lay atop red, white, and blue table cloths labeled ‘Make Coal Great Again,’” AP reported. Indeed, the Acosta Deep Mine in Somerset County, Pennsylvania promises up to 100 jobs and an operation that will create countless tons of metallurgical coal, the ingredient used to make coke, the building block to produce steel  —   a commodity that’s builds much of what America and the world uses, from buildings and bridges to technological devices. The mining will take place at this site over at least the next 15 years, revitalizing an area that was hard hit by the Obama energy policies. The miners will earn between $50, 000 and $100, 000 a year, according to the New York Post  —   a boon to an area where the median income is around $29, 000 a year. The underground mine will eventually stretch out for miles without so much as a blade of grass being disturbed on the lush farmland that dominates the region. “Everyone’s excited about having a mine this big going in,” Ben Gardner, mining engineer with Corsa Coal  the company that owns it, told Breitbart News. And the mine will not only benefit the miners and the local economy, but will have much broader economic impact felt far beyond the Keystone State, from the millions of dollars worth of   equipment used in the operation, to the transportation industry necessary to deliver the coal to its domestic and global destinations. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat who endorsed Hillary Clinton, said the state awarded a $3 million grant for the project. “We have not always capitalized on our standing as one of the world’s leaders in these resources, but we’re changing that,” Wolf said at the mine’s opening. There’s no official signage on the winding roads and picturesque farmland in this part of America, but there’s no doubt this is Trump country. “The war on coal is over,” Corsa CEO George Dethlefsen said. “Easing the regulatory burden, lowering taxes, stimulating infrastructure spending, balancing out the interest of economic growth versus environmental policy  —   it’s very good for coal. ” Corsa hopes to open another metallurgical coal mine next year, and another mine in 2019.",0
"General George Washington delivered a pivotal    impromptu speech on December 31, 1776, that persuaded   veteran Continental Army soldiers to remain in the fight —  a decisive turning point in the Revolutionary War that could have spelled disaster had Washington’s words not won the day. [“It goes to the core of the character of the man,” said Breitbart News Managing Editor and Social Media Director Wynton Hall. “To be able to summon that from within and to project that leadership, to project that vision and strength with all the consequences on the line, it reminds you of how blessed we are as a nation to have been birthed by such a great leader from our founding. ”  During the Breitbart News Daily Fourth of July Special, Hall recounted to SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon the dramatic events leading up to Washington’s   oration. “We have to understand that George Washington had never commanded an army on a large scale,” explained Hall. “We had no money, no training, and were essentially young farm boys. Our equipment was pathetic, we didn’t have proper uniforms, were in tattered rags, and had no proper footwear. John Adams once said more of our men died of dirty frying pans (dysentery) than from musket fire. The British had a phrase for our troops. They called them ‘rabble in arms,’ because we looked like homeless people. ” Against this bleak backdrop, General George Washington, not typically known as a grandiloquent orator, had to project an air of leadership and vision worthy of his men’s following. Hall says Washington used his peerless attire and sizable perceived wealth to forge a “rhetoric of leadership. ” “He looked immaculate and resplendent in his general’s uniform. George Washington was also perceived to be the nation’s richest man. He wasn’t, of course. He was wealthy, but he wasn’t even in the top 10. But that perception —  the notion that he is one of the richest men in America —  was a powerful rhetorical tool in persuading others to think, ‘well, if this man of tremendous wealth is willing to risk it all for the cause of freedom, so, too, should I be willing to risk it all. ’” Hall then recounted in dramatic fashion the critical events of December 31, 1776. “This was, of course, the day when George Washington would try and persuade the Continental Army troops to stay on and fight, even though their enlistments were all up. So here are these   troops who’ve been through and seen hell. And now they can all go home to be with their families —  many of whom needed them financially. ” Washington assembled his men in formation beside the Delaware River. From atop his horse, Washington told his veteran troops he would give them a $10 bonus if they stay on and fight —  a sizable sum given that their typical pay was $6 a month. Washington waited.  But no one stepped forward. The dejected general then rose away on his horse, pondered his army’s plight, decided not to take no for an answer, and rode back before speaking these historic words: “My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected, but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses, and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty, and to your country, which you can probably never do under any other circumstances. ”    soldiers begin stepping forward to answer the call of duty. “You contrast that with today and it’s heartbreaking to see the lack of leadership and lack of character in   that we see today,” said Hall. “But thank God we had it then. ” LISTEN: Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6AM to 9AM Eastern.",0
" (CNN) U. S.  warplanes continued to hammer ISIS positions around the pivotal Iraqi battleground city of Tikrit, stepping in at the Iraqi Prime Minister’s request to get at what a spokesman called ”difficult targets.”  The U. S. military announced Thursday that it and its allies conducted 17 airstrikes around Tikrit, going after three ISIS checkpoints, two bridges, two staging areas and other targets such as a roadblock and a ”command and control facility.” The idea is that this aerial bombardment will pave the way for Iraqi forces to go in and take control on the ground. ”The ongoing Iraqi and coalition airstrikes are setting the conditions for offensive action,”  said Lt. Gen. James L. Terry, commanding general of the U. S.  coalition. Iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back Tikrit since the group, which calls itself the Islamic State, conquered the city in June as part of its campaign to amass an expansive Islamic caliphate. And each time, so far, they’ve failed. The latest push began after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider   on March 1 ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. Militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and  located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Baghdad. ISIS responded by adjusting its positions in and around the city, hiding in buildings and other key infrastructure, said Saad   a spokesman for  . This movement led Iraq’s military to pause its operation, out of growing worries that a   invasion could produce heavy Iraqi military and some civilian casualties. The situation also spurred the Iraqi Prime Minister to request more help.    said the U. S.  coalition has ”advanced technical” and ”powerful” capabilities    not to mention the right munitions    that Iraq’s air force does not have to conduct precision airstrikes. Thus, it was   who specifically asked for the strikes, based on what he heard from military commanders on the ground. If so, the decision would appear to be at odds with what was said just a few weeks ago by some leaders of the predominantly Shiite Muslim forces doing much of the fighting around Tikrit. Some of these Shiite fighters are getting help from the Iranian government, a longstanding and staunch U. S. foe. ”We don’t need it, and we won’t need it,” Hadi   the head of the Hashd   fighting force, said in  . ”Anyone who puts their faith in the international coalition to liberate Iraq is putting their faith on a mirage.” Thus,   is taking a bit of a gamble by having the U. S.  coalition play any part in this fight. He hopes it pays off by not only ousting ISIS from Tikrit, but setting the stage for Iraqi forces to take back an even bigger prize: Mosul. ”There is high morale to liberate this city from ISIS and the terrorists. I would like to assure all the citizens that there are almost no civilians remaining in the city now, and there are only terrorists,”   said Thursday during a visit to Tikrit.  He said operations were going as planned, and that forces were in the final stages of liberating Tikrit. Mosul is Iraq’s   city and the site of one of its military’s biggest embarrassments, when Iraqi troops dropped their weapons and ran rather than defend their posts last June. A U. S. official said in February that up to 25, 000 Iraqi troops plan to return to Mosul in April or May and, ideally, win it back.  This comment came days after   told the BBC that while there’s still work to do, he felt confident Iraqis could recapture the key northern city. ”We are now planning an offensive on Mosul in the coming few months,” the Prime Minister said. ”We have to prepare for it carefully, because the only choice we have in Mosul (is to win). We have to win in Mosul to keep (ISIS) out.”",0
"The voter fraud conviction of Texas resident and Mexican national Rosa Maria Ortega should make it clear we need citizenship verification in voter registration. Over and over, Austin considers bills that would keep ineligible voters from the ballot box —  only to see them die quiet deaths in committee. That can’t happen anymore. [State Senator Van Taylor ( ) and Representative Mike Schofield ( ) have introduced companion bills that would require documentary proof of U. S. citizenship when a Texas resident decides to register to vote. Items like valid passports, birth certificates, and naturalization papers would be presented within a reasonable window of time for registration to be complete.  The Ortega case perfectly demonstrates the necessity of these bills. The voter registration process is one of the remaining aspects of elections that still rely on the honor system. Before she voted “five times between 2004 and 2014” as Attorney General Ken Paxton notes, there were multiple attempts at voter registration. The Texas registration form merely asks, “are you a United States citizen?” The honor system failed with Ortega and is failing across America. Unfortunately, this problem was created by the Motor Voter law in 1993 which made the failing honor system federal law. When residing in Dallas County, Ortega checked “Yes” on the form and cast multiple ballots. She subsequently relocated to Tarrant County and changed her answer, later complaining that she had no trouble voting in the past. She was caught by chance. Many, many more are not. There aren’t any   immigration databases being used to catch ineligible voters. The ones that do exist, Texas has not used. Don’t count on local law enforcement to communicate with federal immigration agents, especially in “sanctuary” jurisdictions like Dallas and Austin, either. HB 1079 and SB 136 provide a way to fix the problem. We’ve presented evidence in federal court showing  how 13 prospective voters in Houston registered when they should have been stopped. Four applicants actually checked the “No” box on the form, saying plainly they were not citizens. Six others checked both “Yes” and “No” on the form, yet were registered. Others didn’t answer the question at all, but were registered anyway. I’ve personally sued counties in south Texas where there were more registrants on the rolls than adult citizens alive. Naturally, they weren’t using all the tools available to detect alien registrations. Critics of these bills are almost certain to travel down familiar paths. Leftists will argue that having to provide proof of citizenship is the return of Jim Crow. Opponents could not be further from the truth. It costs nothing to obtain a copy of a birth certificate for the purpose of receiving a voter identification card. The Texas Department of State Health Services would only need to expand its administrative rule to cover transactions related to voter registration. Mexican transplants in the Lone Star eligible to vote came from a country that requires proof of citizenship to join the voter registry. A photo voter ID is also required to cast a ballot in Mexico. The purported victims of any citizenship verification effort will in fact be familiar with the process and have the necessary documents at the ready. The only people who will suffer from citizenship verification laws are ineligible   who try to vote in our elections. Just electing a new President does not fix the problems with the integrity of our elections. Washington isn’t the solution when it comes to election integrity anyhow —  nor should it be. If Texas’ voters want to see free and fair elections, they must demand them from Austin. J.

"Two prominent north Texas Democrats are sounding the alarm on the threat of a   concern: voter fraud. [Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D) and State Representative Eric Johnson (  100) submitted a letter Thursday to Dallas County Elections Administrator Toni   after public concerns continued to mount about scores of reports involving a potential absentee voter fraud scheme.  “According to reports, dozens of voters received   ballots they never requested,” the letter states, which “suggests the possibility of a coordinated effort to benefit a candidate or candidates in the upcoming Dallas City Council elections. ” As Breitbart Texas previously reported, the episode began when West   pastor James Armstrong alerted local media and officials alike that some of his congregants came forward with evidence that absentee ballots were arriving at their respective homes without first asking for them, as Texas law requires. “It’s just a travesty that we are dealing with this,” Armstrong told NBC DFW at the time. “Seniors who have lived in this neighborhood all of their life and are now being taken advantage of. ” Another community resident, Alice Washington, 81, lodged similar complaints with the County via her niece, Barbara Roberson. “I said, ‘Would you please send me a copy of that application because I’d like to see her signature’,” Roberson told WFAA at the time. “Someone forged her signature,” said Roberson after review of the paperwork. In the week following, dozens of similar complaints have been made, according to Mayor Rawlings’ joint letter. The duo also notes a possible pattern in recent elections: What’s more startling is that this is the second time in less than a year that we have heard reports of irregularities in West Dallas. In November, media reports indicated someone fraudulently mailed ballots for dozens of elderly or dead voters. Previous Breitbart Texas coverage noted where election integrity experts explained root causes for the latest episode and steps Texas can take to fix the matter going forward: Election integrity advocates have argued that absentee ballot problems can sometimes be rooted in poor maintenance of the underlying voter records. The Public Interest Legal Foundation noted in response to the Dallas episode that Texas should consider tightening procedures for requesting absentee ballots. “As long as you have a name and address of another voter, you’re good to go   …     You don’t even need to give a birth date,” a group spokesperson told Lifezette. Analysts say that requiring absentee ballot applications to include driver’s license or other   identification numbers could cut down impersonation attempts like claimed by the Washington family. Recent fraud conspiracies prosecuted in southern Texas point to a possible example for how elderly voters are preyed upon through the mail voting system. After an unsolicited ballot arrives, an illicit     political operative would visit the recipient’s home, offering “assistance” with completing and returning the form with   candidates in mind. One recent Texas case involved a U. S. Postal Service delivery man taking bribes in trade for allowing “politiqueras” to follow his truck, indicating which homes received ballots. The mailman also allegedly took part in campaigning for local Democrat candidates while in uniform as well. Short of legislative reforms, Mayor Rawlings and Rep. Johnson were left to implore   to “devote additional resources to verify the integrity of each   ballot in Dallas. ” Rawlings Johnson Re Mail Ballots by BreitbartTexas on Scribd,  Logan Churchwell is a founding editor of the Breitbart Texas team.

" (CNN) On what would have been the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ’s 86th birthday, the Academy Awards decided to snub a beautiful film made about a seminal moment in his life.  ”Selma” did pick up two nominations, including one for best picture. But when the Hollywood gods consider a film to be truly great, its actors   actresses, screenplay and particularly its director are also recognized. ”Selma” is a good film that told a great story, at least according to Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters. Those voters are 93% white, 76% male and the average age is 63, according to a 2012 analysis by the Los Angeles Times.  But did those demographics play a role in how ”Selma” was received? True, the historical drama has been besieged by criticism over accuracy, particularly its portrayal of President Lyndon Johnson. In the film, King and Johnson are depicted as a lot more adversarial than the actual tapes of their conversation suggests.   But it’s hard to see that being the reason for its snub: ”Gravity” was nominated for 10 Oscars, won seven, and yet you won’t find an astronaut who would describe the film as accurate. And ”Dallas Buyer’s Club” was also a 2014 Oscar darling that sprinkled creative liberties all over a true story.  Race could be invoked as a factor when you remember the email exchange between two   Sony executives that became public courtesy of  ”The Interview” hack. In it they joked about the kind of movie President Obama prefers and then began listing only those starring black people. But the two were also unkind to Jeffrey Katzenberg in that same exchange. There were backstabbing remarks revealed in emails about Angelina Jolie and Adam Sandler as well.  My point is    and I’m sure I’m at risk of losing my black card for writing this    when those same old, white men made ”12 Years A Slave” a favorite of the Oscars just a year ago, it is hard to say the snubbing of ”Selma” is all about the demographics of the voters. Some, sure. But all?  Remember, these people live in a land of make believe, where it’s normal for the inhabitants to be injected with silicone. Oscar snubbings could come from a thousand superficial reasons, like someone sleeping with or not sleeping with the right person at the right time. In a town full of gay men, the heart wrenching ”Brokeback Mountain” somehow lost out to the woefully mediocre ”Crash.” Leonardo DiCaprio’s trophy case continues to sit empty. And I will never understand how ”Shakespeare in Love” beat ”Saving Private Ryan” for best picture. Truth be told. my favorite film of 2014 was ”The Drop” and I don’t think that was nominated for anything by anyone.   It would have been wonderful to see ”Selma” director Ava DuVernay become the first black female director nominated for an Oscar. She is incredibly talented and it is always nice to be recognized by peers. But I do not need her to win an Oscar to tell me how I should feel about ”Selma.”  I do not need the Academy to tell me how I should spend my money at the movies. I do not need old, white men to validate a story so deeply personal and relevant to me today. That’s not to suggest Hollywood’s racism should not be called out. Only that the true story of Selma is much more than calling out racism.  To paraphrase the acceptance speech Common gave at the Golden Globes on Sunday, ”Selma” the movie and Selma the historic marches are about the awakening of our humanity. The old guard at the Oscars has the power to snub ”Selma” for whatever reason it sees fit. But as a summer full of marches for the fight for equality reminded us, Hollywood has neither the power to snub nor the authority to validate Selma.  Read CNNOpinion’s new Flipboard magazine.

"Washington (CNN) Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg offered a dark assessment of the country’s current state in a pair of interviews Thursday, but said there was reason to hope for better in the long run.  Although she didn’t mention President Donald Trump by name, she said the country was not mindful of ”what makes America great” while stressing the importance of a free speech and ”the idea of our nation being receptive to all people, welcoming all people.” ”For the most part, those are our ideals, our treasured First Amendment and the notion that in our nation we are many and yet we are one,” she said in a discussion moderated by NPR’s Nina Totenberg and   by the Newseum and the Supreme Court Fellows Association in Washington. It is rare for a member of the high court to speak out on the current state of the country, and Ginsburg’s observations come months after the characteristically outspoken justice courted  controversy when she criticized Trump, calling him a ”faker.” Trump harshly replied, quipping, ”Her mind is shot.” A few days later, she issued an apology and said the remarks were inappropriate for a judge to make. On Thursday, she noted the importance of diversity and said she herself was a beneficiary of a father who was able ”to leave the old world where the conditions were not good to come here and make a living and raise a family    that is America to me, ” she said to a round of applause. The justice also weighed in on Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, whom she knows personally. ”I think he is very easy to get along with. He writes very well,” she said. ’Not experiencing the best of times’ In an earlier interview with the BBC that aired on Thursday, the Supreme Court’s eldest member and liberal stalwart used similarly stark terms for the state of the country, faith in its institutions and problems in the legislative branch    all while talking around its newly minted leader, Trump. ”I would say that we are not experiencing the best of times, but there’s hope in seeing how the public is reacting to it,” Ginsburg said. She pointed to the demonstrations following Trump’s inauguration as ”reason to hope that we will see a better day.” ”The Women’s March    I’ve never seen such a demonstration, both the numbers and the rapport of the people in that crowd. There was no violence. It was orderly,” Ginsburg said.  Ginsburg, who was appointed by former Democratic President Bill Clinton, also praised freedom of the press in the United States and said it is important to guarantee that freedom. ”I live in the famous Watergate. That story might never have come out if we didn’t have the free press,” Ginsburg said, referring to the scandal that led to former President Richard Nixon’s ouster. Asked why she brought up the free press, Ginsburg cited two major newspapers as informative and defended the intentions of their reporters. ”I read The Washington Post and The New York Times every day,” Ginsburg said. ”I think that the reporters are trying to tell the public the way things are.” The court is currently in a   split between what has widely been regarded as its liberal and conservative wings following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last year. To fill the vacant seat, Trump has nominated Gorsuch, a judge whose judicial philosophy has been similar to Scalia’s. With the narrow split of the court and Ginsburg’s age an obvious issue, she indicated she would continue to serve indefinitely. ”At my age, you have to take it year by year. I know I’m OK this year,” Ginsburg told BBC. ”I’m hopeful, however, because my most senior colleague, the one who most recently retired, Justice John Paul Stevens, stepped down at age 90, so I have a way to go.” Asked if she would serve until she was 90, Ginsburg responded: ”As I said, at this age of my life, I take it year by year.”",0
"Asheville, North Carolina (CNN) Police issued a warrant Tuesday for the arrest of a man whom reporters witnessed grabbing a protester by the neck and apparently hitting him in the face during a Donald Trump campaign rally. The Asheville Police Department issued a warrant for Thomas Vellanti Jr. ’s arrest on Tuesday morning after footage of the altercation on Monday, which the police department called an ”assault,” circulated on social media and in national news reports. ”This morning, the Asheville Police Department followed up on the incident and obtained warrants for the suspect, Thomas Vellanti Jr. ,” the police department said in a statement. ”The Asheville Police Department worked diligently to protect both those attending the rally and those exercising their right to protest.” ”APD has taken out warrants on Thomas Vellanti Jr. for the assault which was caught on video last night at the Donald Trump Rally. #AVLPD,” the police department tweeted Tuesday. The Trump campaign has not answered requests for comment. A call to Vellanti also went unanswered. A CNN reporter saw Vellanti accosting a group of eight protesters who began shouting in the middle of Trump’s rally and exchanged words with one man before grabbing him by the neck while brandishing his closed fist. Vellanti then appeared to swing at the protester, but it’s unclear if the protester dodged the punch. Police officers, who were stationed throughout the arena of Trump’s rally, were not involved in the incident and Vellanti remained at the rally. The incident on Monday came as Trump lambasted Hillary Clinton for calling half of his supporters a ”basket of deplorables,” accusing her of running a ” ” campaign. And moments earlier, Trump had brought a group of supporters on stage, proclaiming them   Americans, not ”deplorables.” Clinton has said she regretted saying the word ”half,” but said she will continue to call out the ”bigotry” in the Trump campaign. Reporters also witnessed Vellanti trying to grab a female protester who was also being escorted out of the building. And when a woman in a hijab tried to sit down as the group of protesters were ejected, the man shouted, ”Get out!” and motioned for her to leave. After the protesters were ejected, Vellanti extended his arms, raising his clenched fists like a victorious boxer. The incidents occurred as a Trump campaign staffer arrived by the group of protesters to escort them out of the rally. The staffer did not ask the supporter to leave the rally. Past incidents of violence, The altercation is not the first incident of violence at a Trump rally. A Trump supporter in Fayetteville, North Carolina, was charged with assault in March after he punched a protester as he was being escorted from the venue by police. Trump later suggested he might pay for the man’s legal bills. And last fall, a Black Lives Matter protester was tackled, punched and kicked by a Trump supporter at a rally in Birmingham, Alabama. Trump later said that man maybe ”should have been roughed up.” Trump has also been accused of stoking violence at his rallies, telling supporters during a February rally that he’d ”like to punch him (a protester) in the face.” ”In the old days,” Trump added then, protesters would be ”carried out on a stretcher.” But Trump has sought to mollify the tone of his campaign, saying at more recent rallies that his supporters should be   toward protesters. As he slammed Clinton for saying that half of his supporters are ”racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic,” Trump argued that every American deserves ”leadership that honors you, cherishes you and totally defends you.” ”Every American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country,” he said.",0
"NBA Commissioner Adam Silver calls it a “missed opportunity” if the league refuses to send members to celebrate the NBA Finals championship at the White House under President Donald Trump. [In an interview with Mike Wise of TheUndefeated. com, Silver seemed to urge players to take their political activism right to the top instead of trying to make a statement by boycotting the Trump White House.  “To me, if a player were to choose not to go to the White House, whether they were choosing not to go to the current White House or a future White House, my response would be: ‘That’s a lost opportunity,’” Silver said. “Because that’s an opportunity that most citizens who have a political point of view would kill for  —   the opportunity to directly tell the president of the United States how they feel about an issue. ” “Now, if the president were to say, ‘I have no interest in what members of the NBA think about an issue,’ that might surprise me and I might have a different response,” Silver added. But Silver also noted that the office itself is bigger than any single president. “The institution is bigger than any one man, whether that man be President Obama or President Trump. Ultimately players have to make their own decisions. But if they were seeking my counsel, my counsel would be that they should go to the White House if offered the opportunity,” he said. Silver’s comments, though, raise the question as to just what he wants players to do. Usually the NBA uses these champion visits to the White House for league advertising, a quick handshake, some short banter, and a photo op with the President of the United States. Never have players used this time for controversial political statements. But with his interview it appears that Silver might urge players to disrupt the normal photo op of past practice and turn an NBA Finals champion visit to the White House into one pushing Black Lives Matter activism or other such issues instead of selling basketball to America. In 2017, will members of the NBA use their visit to the White House as a disruptive event instead of a celebration of excellence? Silver seems to say exactly that. Indeed, later in the interview Silver agreed that basketball should be used for activism. “I do feel a particular obligation to focus on the   community in that we have a league that is roughly 75 percent ” the commissioner said. “And I feel part of the obligation comes from the history of this league that I’ve inherited. ” Yet, Silver later tried to roll all that urge to activism back, cautioning against “bright lines” that the league should not toe. “Let me just say we’re not looking for opportunities to jump in from a political standpoint,” Silver said. “I think we deal with whatever set of circumstances are dealt to us. No one in this league could have predicted when we awarded the   Game to North Carolina that we’d be dealing with the LGBT community and fundamental rights, including access to bathrooms. ” “We don’t like to be in the business of drawing bright lines. We realize the complexity of the world,” Silver added. It appears the Commissioner wants to have it both ways, he wants the league to indulge political activism while at the same time not doing so. Silver also acknowledged that fans getting sick and tired of having politics served up with their basketball. “I hear fans loud and clear who say, ‘How is it that you do business in China when you move the   Game out of North Carolina? ’” Silver said. “Because there are not a lot of fundamental protections afforded Chinese citizens that are afforded to American citizens. And I   …     I don’t have a    response to that. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
"A left wing activist has bared all to a Norwegian documentary crew about his rape at the hands of a Somalian migrant, and his despair at seeing the man deported. [An active member of the Norwegian Socialist Left Party (SV) who described himself as an ardent “feminist and  ” explained the difficulty he experienced accepting that he had been anally raped by a male migrant. He said he didn’t blame the man for the attack, and regretted the fact he had been sent back to Somalia.  Describing the process of reconciling his personally held beliefs, young SV activist Karsten Nordal Hauken said the experience left him “feeling nothing” reports Norwegian state broadcaster NRK. Attacked as a young man, his rapist was convicted six months after the fact with DNA evidence removed from Mr. Hauken’s body at the time of his rape, and fingerprints taken from his bedroom. The Somalian male was later caught when he was found to be carrying a knife in public and his fingerprints were a match. Although he protested his innocence and claimed he had been enjoying a consensual relationship with Mr. Hauken, the migrant was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. After the completion of his jail term, the man was deported back to Somalia, something which his victim greeted with mixed emotions. Speaking to NRK ahead of a new documentary series about young people in Norway dealing with mental illness, Mr. Hauken said of the moment when he was told by telephone at work that his attacker was to be deported: “I was a bit taken by surprise by this message. “But I remained calm enough to tell the manager that I had to go. The tears, they came the moment I sat in the car. I felt a relief and joy that he was going away forever. I felt that the Norwegian government took on the responsibility to exercise the ultimate revenge, like an angry father who confronts a child abuser. “But I also got a strong sense of guilt and responsibility. I was the reason why he should not have to leave Norway, and heading for a very uncertain future in Somalia. He had already served his sentence in prison. Should he now be punished again? And this time much harder?” Mr. Hauken found himself unable to blame his attacker, saying “he is not responsible for his actions”. Rather than the rapist being in charge of his own destiny, he said he was merely “a product of an unjust world. A product of an upbringing marked by war and deprivation” and said that rather than the attack being sexually motivated, it was all about “exerting power” over him. The attack had not in any way dulled his   politics, either. Mr. Hauken said: “I stand rock solid in my opinion that people like him need our help. I want us to continue to help refugees with such a background  …     For I am a human being first, and not a Norwegian. No, I’m part of the world, and the world is unfortunately unfair”. This is not the first example of leftist political activists allowing their close proximity to the migrant communities which they strive so hard to defend to cause them harm. Breitbart London reported last year on the   stabbing of an open borders, pro mass migration activist in Dresden. Standing outside a   the student was jumped and stabbed in the back by a gang of North Africans. He said that the event had left him feeling “very sad” and he hoped it wouldn’t be used to demonise migrants. Another young activist fallen victim to their own politics was one woman volunteering at a migrant camp on the   border. While the migrants living at the facility held a party, she was cornered in a   and gang raped by a group of African males, her screams unheard over the music. Concious that her attack could be used to damage the peaceful reputation of migrants, she decided to cover up her own rape. ",0
"Lynchburg, Virginia (CNN) It’s an audacious gambit, opening a presidential campaign after merely a brief stop in the U. S. Senate. But if it worked for a freshman senator from Illinois, could it work for one from Texas? Barack Obama and Ted Cruz both have Ivy League credentials, with degrees from Harvard Law School. They both have two young daughters. They both served in the Senate for only two years before defying conventional wisdom and declaring their lofty White House ambitions. The similarities may well stop there for Obama and Cruz, who at 44 is just one year younger than Obama when he launched his improbable presidential bid eight years ago. But the success of Obama    at the ballot box, at least, in 2008 and 2012    is helping to fuel the aspirations of Cruz and other Republican hopefuls in the opening chapter of this campaign.  If Obama could overtake the mighty Hillary Clinton back then, could Cruz compete with the powerful establishment behind Jeb Bush’s anticipated candidacy? RELATED: Ted Cruz ’imagines’ 2016 presidency in Liberty speech, As Cruz swept onto the stage here Monday, smiling and waving before an audience of 10, 000 students at Liberty University, the scene carried the feeling of a rally from those early Obama days. He made his announcement inside the Vines Center, an arena where the Liberty Flames play basketball, in a setting made for television (not to mention future television commercials.) ”Today, I am announcing that I am running for president of the United States,” Cruz said, making his intentions clear near the end of a speech rich in biography and ideology. ”It is a time for truth. It is a time for liberty. It is a time to reclaim the Constitution of the United States.” Whether or not Cruz becomes the 45th president of the United States, much less wins the Republican nomination, is hardly the only point worth considering about his candidacy. With those words, and with his    call for conservative purity, Cruz illustrated perhaps his greatest influence on the race: He is the candidate who can pull the debate to the right, to remind party activists they have no obligation to follow history and go the establishment route. That, of course, is where the comparisons to Obama and Cruz end. In the beginning, at least, Obama spoke of bridging the partisan divide. Cruz did not mention the word compromise, but rather how he intended to build a campaign that encouraged evangelicals to come to the polls with as much force as   Democrats and moderates did in 2008. RELATED: Ted Cruz to lose Goldman Sachs health benefits, The road to moderation, he said, was a road to defeat for the Republican Party. ”I want to ask each of you to imagine, imagine millions of courageous conservatives across America rising up together to say in unison, we demand our liberty,” Cruz said, adding that he believes about half of   Christians don’t routinely vote. ”Imagine millions of people of faith all across American coming out to the polls and voting our values? For nearly 30 minutes on Monday, as he delivered his remarks without notes or a Teleprompter as he slowly circled the stage, Cruz showed that he, too, has a gift of oratory. He held the attention of most Liberty University students, who were required to attend their weekly convocation, or be fined $10. The biggest applause lines came when Cruz offered a sharp critique of Obama, particularly health care on the fifth anniversary of the President signing the bill into law.  Left unspoken, though, was perhaps the biggest way Obama’s presence will influence Cruz and other senators poised to jump into the 2016 presidential race.  Will the country send another   senator to the White House? Or is there a reason why voters have tended to elect senators only every generation or so?  ",0
"LONDON  —   The Conservative Party (and by extension, Britain itself) is moving a step closer to a new leader. Members of the opposition Labour Party are wondering if their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will save them or plunge the party into irrelevancy. Here’s what’s happening in today’s Brexit news: • Among the Conservatives, Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, has decided not to run to replace David Cameron as party leader (and therefore prime minister). That leaves the favorite as Home Secretary Theresa May, but Michael Gove, the justice secretary, has also thrown his hat in the ring. A leaked email showed Mr. Gove’s wife to be no fan of Mr. Johnson, and both candidates criticized him while announcing their candidacy. Plenty of others plan to run as well. • On the opposition side, Labour is not happy with its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who appears more concerned with remaking the party into a revolutionary socialist movement than achieving power. Members of Parliament, including Mr. Corbyn’s predecessor as party leader, want him to resign. He has refused. The party is also awaiting the release of an internal investigation into claims of  . • Where could it all lead? Steven Erlanger, the London bureau chief for The New York Times, says there could be an early general election in Britain. • The Bank of England may be forced to cut a key interest rate this summer as it grapples with economic uncertainty created by Brexit, Mark Carney, the central bank’s governor, said on Thursday. “It now seems plausible that uncertainty could remain elevated for some time, with a greater drag on activity than we had previously projected,” Mr. Carney said. He added that, in his view, “the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer,” though he was careful to say he was not prescribing what other members of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee would eventually decide. “The charge that central banks are out of monetary ammunition is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed,” he said. • A new runway at Heathrow Airport in London won’t be decided on until a new prime minister is in place, the BBC reports. The Financial Times has published a “business tracker” on how companies are responding to the vote. • A series of tweets by the Economist Intelligence Unit outlines the negative possibilities for the British economy. • In the markets, the pound was mostly flat in morning trading in London. British stocks, which had fallen sharply after the referendum result on Friday morning, closed above their   levels on Wednesday. The same goes for share prices in Continental Europe. • Internet search patterns indicate many people are still looking up what “Brexit” is and what it means to leave the European Union. Plenty is still unknown, but we have an article that explains the basics. • Tony Blair’s former chief of staff wrote in The Guardian that Britain’s withdrawal can still be reversed, but that it will take courage. An academic wrote on Medium that most English and Welsh lawmakers would have to go against the wishes of their constituents. • Is the European Union “democratic”? Campaigners who sought to leave the bloc said it was not, but my colleague Amanda Taub argues it is  —   it just doesn’t feel that way. Philip Stephens, looking at another European country that had an   portmanteau, worries in The Financial Times that Britain is behaving more like Greece. • Could Britain’s influence in Hong Kong wane? The Guardian’s Beijing correspondent asks if Britain’s fledgling “golden relationship” with China could be in jeopardy. And in China, a censorship notice has told editors not to “hype the story, speculate or comment” on the exit. There will be plenty more to come throughout the day.",0
"Virginia Republican congressman Dave Brat told Breitbart News Saturday radio host Matt Boyle that the American Health Care Act bill written by Speaker Paul Ryan (R. .) is designed to save the insurance companies, not return health insurance and health care delivery to the free market. [Brat said the speaker is worried about the insurance companies, who backed the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, because the system they created cannot be sustained because of its perverse incentives, regulations, and costs.  In addition to the flaws in the Obamacare legislation and buildout, the congressman said it is foolish to attempt a political solution to an economic problem that forces you to accommodate the needs and values of 300 million Americans  —   such as people in both California and Texas  —   at the same time. The RyanCare bill is not connected to the promises President Donald Trump made on the campaign trail, said the former head of the economic department at   College. “We want Trump to be hugely successful, so we don’t want to handle a bill that’s going to fail in a few years,” he said. “Trump ran on   and competition across state lines, getting the price down  —   the price is going up by 20 percent and the bill we are getting ready to vote on, once again, goes back and does too much emphasis on the coverage aspect,” he said. Focusing on coverage makes it impossible for the bill to ever work, he said. “Five percent of the people with   conditions, et cetera  —   very serious issues that every bill deals with  —   but five percent of the folks will cost 50 percent of the entire health care market,” he said. A   condition has nothing to do with insurance, because the person already had the problem, he said. “That is not an insurance problem. That is a health care problem, and we’ve got to fix that. For the rest of the 300 million, we’ve got to design an efficient system that follows   logic, where you get to go shop. ” Obamacare has many rules and restrictions governing how the insurance companies structure policies and run their own firms, he said. Lifting the regulatory burden on the insurance industry would free them to innovate, he said, “In the current bill, I’ve asked leadership, budget committee experts: ‘Can a young person go out and buy a health care insurance product of their choosing?’ The answer is no,” he said. The reason is that the regulations on the insurance companies require certain “essential health care benefits,” so that everyone in the country is forced to buy the same coverage, whether they need it or not,” Brat said. In the RyanCare bill, the individual mandate was supposed to go away, but instead, it is reconfigured as a continuing care option tied to the   condition protections, he said. Under Ryancare someone can go without insurance for 10 years and then upon learning they have cancer, sign up for “insurance. ” Brat said the only penalty would be a 30 percent surcharge upon their premiums. “It is a perverse economic system. ” The congressman said nothing makes the politics of the RyanCare bill more plain than the fact that in 2015, Republicans in the House and Senate passed a   repeal of Obamacare  —   when everyone knew it would be vetoed by President Barack Obama. Now with real bullets, Republicans are stepping away from repeal to put forward a RyanCare bill that preserves the structure and spirit of Obamacare. The speaker’s bill is unlikely to pass the House, but even if it makes it to the Senate, it will not pass there, either, Brat said. Then, hopefully, the Republican leadership will work with Capitol Hill conservatives to craft a true repeal of Obamacare that synchs up with what Trump promised the American people, Bratt concluded.",0
" (CNN) Charles Murray came to the campus of Middlebury College (where I’ve taught for more than 30 years) on Thursday, and his appearance provoked protests that went beyond anything seen here since the 1960s.   All hell broke loose, as hundreds of students turned their backs on Murray, a political scientist with controversial views, and began to chant: ”Who is the enemy? White supremacy!” and ”Racist, sexist,   Charles Murray, go away!” Unable to deliver his talk, the speaker was spirited to another location, where he engaged in a discussion moderated by a member of the government department. On their way to a waiting car, Murray and the professor escorting him were confronted by protesters. Pushing and shoving quickly degenerated into outright violence, and the professor who moderated the event, Allison Stanger, was injured and taken to a hospital. (She is a good friend of mine, and is, thankfully, OK.)  Murray is, of course,   of the 1994 book ”The Bell Curve”    a contentious and largely discredited study of intelligence and its variations within American society.  Writing in The New Yorker, Stephen Jay Gould    the late Harvard evolutionary biologist    wrote that the argument in this book about intelligence and racial difference is ”as old as the study of race, and is most surely fallacious.”   After nearly 25 years, Murray’s thesis holds very little water, although he remains a hero of sorts among some commentators on the right.  Needless to say, he is not much liked on the left.   Indeed, the Southern Poverty Law Center lambastes Murray for using ”misleading statistics to argue that social inequality is caused by the genetic inferiority of black and Latino communities, women and the poor.” They quote him in various contexts, and it’s not pleasant reading. Despite all of this, Murray does not seem a likely target for protests of the kind that happened at Middlebury. He was, in effect, brought out of cold storage for this talk, a relic of the era when the debate over political correctness first began to boil in the  ’90s. A student group had invited him, and (wisely) the government department at the college decided to   the event.   Two large questions, for me, arise. First, why were the students so upset? And then, why did they behave so badly? I spend most of my weekdays in conversation with students, and I know they’re upset by the election of a bigoted man to the White House, someone who consistently derided Mexicans (among others) during his run for the presidency. That he is a   serial assaulter of women remains a point of agitation for many, even if he insists his account of this behavior was just   talk. His bullying tactics with anyone who opposes him or his ideas have rattled students, who see him as the antithesis of what people in the ”academic village” consider appropriate in presidential behavior.  At Middlebury, like elsewhere on campuses, many students are extremely conscious of assaults to the environment, and    to them    Trump represents a huge threat, someone who can undo years of progress. You get the idea. They have a lot to upset them. But I was nonetheless startled by their rude behavior, their refusal even to hear Charles Murray speak. One can perhaps excuse the students on grounds of immaturity. But that’s not good enough. They must learn to listen, learn how to object in a proper,   way to arguments that seem, after consideration, wrong, even repugnant. It is especially important in the Trump era that we don’t allow bullying tactics to color the tone of discussions. There are ways to talk about important things and appropriate ways to protest. And some forms of protest only provoke thoughtless reactions and bad feelings.   Students, and their elders as well, must not lose sight of these distinctions.",0
" (CNN) Sarah Brady, who with her husband, James Brady, pushed for stricter gun control laws, including the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, died Friday, her family said.  Brady, 73, died of pneumonia, the family said.  ”Sarah courageously stepped up after Jim was shot to prevent others from enduring what our family has gone through, and her work has saved countless lives,” their statement said. James Brady, President Ronald Reagan’s press secretary, was shot in the head by John Hinckley Jr. during his attempt to assassinate Reagan in 1981. Brady spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair, advocating against gun violence.  He died in August.  Sarah Brady was also involved in gun violence prevention for the past 30 years. She was the chairwoman of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence from 2000 until she died.  The National Rifle Association said its thoughts and prayers were with the Brady family. ”Although we disagreed on public policy, Sarah Brady was an honorable American who we always respected,” the gun rights organization said.  People we’ve lost in 2015, On the Brady Campaign’s website, she said she got involved in gun control after her young son picked up what she thought was a toy gun on the seat of a friend’s pickup. Her son started to wave it around and she took it from him. It was not a toy, she said, and she fumed over what she imagined could have happened. The loaded gun was much like the one used to shoot her husband. ”It just hit me like a ton of bricks,” she told CNN in 2013. ”So I asked Jim if he felt comfortable with me speaking out, and he said, ’Of course. ’”  After that, the Bradys made it their business to be gun control activists.  Despite budgets that were just a fraction of the gun lobby’s, the Bradys and their colleagues helped pass federal and state laws, including Maryland’s 1988 ban on cheap handguns known as Saturday night specials, 1993’s Brady law requiring background checks on certain kinds of gun purchases and a ban on manufacturing and future sales of some   firearms, which lasted from 1994 to 2004. Read Sarah Brady’s 2014   for CNN. com, Former President Bill Clinton, who signed the Brady bill in 1993, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a joint statement Saturday that the Bradys ”were fierce champions of sensible gun legislation.” Sarah Brady ”transformed tragedy into a courageous campaign, and because of her work and her remarkable life, American families are safer today,” the Clintons said. Brady Campaign and Center President Dan Gross said in a written statement that few people are responsible for saving as many lives as Sarah and James Brady.  ”Our nation has lost a great hero, and I have lost a dear friend,” he said. ”I am certain that she would want nothing more than to know we are carrying on her and Jim’s legacy with the same fiery compassion and dedication that made her so remarkable.” Sen Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who helped write the Brady bill, concurred.  ”She was strong and forceful, sweet and kind, and someone I considered a friend and patriot for decades,” he said. ”She was a true hero and will be missed by America.” James Brady was one of four people wounded in Reagan’s shooting outside a Washington hotel. Suffering a head wound, it was erroneously reported at one point that Brady had died. He was, however, left partially paralyzed. Reagan, severely wounded as well, also survived the attack and served two terms as President. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting and has spent the ensuing years in a psychiatric hospital. The Brady bill was fiercely fought over for seven years before Congress approved it and President Bill Clinton signed it into law in 1993.",0
"Hillary Clinton campaign chief John Podesta warned staffers that Hillary would be unavailable to personally address a controversy in the campaign. [“She’s down tomorrow and needs (t) o stay down,” he wrote shortly, after a Democratic consultant urged Clinton to call “Chris Geidner at BuzzFeed” to address the situation personally.   The email was part of Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta’s emails released by WikiLeaks. The controversy featured Clinton’s position on the Defense of Marriage Act signed by former President Bill Clinton while he was in office, stirring a negative reaction from the LGBT community. During an interview with Rachel Maddow, Clinton argued that her husband signed the bill to stop “political momentum” to amend the Constitution. “There had to be some way to stop that,” Clinton said. “In a lot of ways, DOMA was a line that was drawn that was to prevent going further. ” That message rang hollow to liberal LGBT activists, who called the Clintons out on the talking point. Hillary’s rival Bernie Sanders also took up the fight. “Today, some are trying to rewrite history by saying that they voted for one antigay law to stop something worse,” Sanders said pointedly during his speech at the   dinner in Iowa. “That’s not the case. ” The Huffington Post’s Sam Stein and Jennifer Bendery tackled the issue in detail, sending alarm bells off in the campaign. Richard Socarides, Bill Clinton’s former aide on gay rights issues and a current Democratic strategist, worked with Podesta to stem the damage. He sent the following advice: Best if she says something to a reporter herself. She could call Chris Geidner at BuzzFeed. I know that’s hard. Second best is put out a statement on paper. Either from her or you or Jen. I could help write it. Third option, possible for somebody to call a reporter on her behalf. Call someone with whom we have a relationship and explain, or I could call and try to explain it but this is definitely not as good as the first two, at least by itself. In another email chain, the Clinton campaign squabbled back and forth for the best reaction to the controversy apparently before the Huffington Post article was published. “There is, IMO, deep discontent out there stemming from what she said on Friday,” Dominic Lowell, the LGBT Outreach Director for Clinton’s campaign warned. Some aides supported the idea of walking back Clinton’s comments others didn’t. “Keep in mind: the story will suck regardless,” wrote Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon. “But I would just say we should use it as the vehicle for giving a statement that reads as a walkback, even as HRC will never approve a true walkback. ” Fallon advised against Clinton herself making a statement, but admitted that the campaign needed to do something to “quell the LGBT backlash. ” By circulating the Huffington Post story, he argued, “our LGBT friends” could see that they successfully humbled the campaign enough to walk it back. “We are blowing this people. Chains of 40 emails aren’t helping,” a frustrated Podesta replied. Eventually, Fallon drafted the following statement that was used by the Huffington Post in their article. Whatever the context that led to the passage of DOMA nearly two decades ago, Hillary Clinton believes the law was discriminatory and both she and President Clinton urged that it be overturned. As President, Hillary Clinton will continue to fight to secure full and equal rights for LGBT Americans who, despite all our progress, can still get married on a Saturday and fired on a Monday just because of who they are and who they love. The article also included a quote from Socarides: “(T) here is no question that President Clinton believed that one of the reasons he was willing to sign a bill that he did not like was because he thought he would prevent greater damage. ”",0

The incident occurred Saturday night near the intersection of Orleans and Carrollton Avenues where the Krewe of Endymion parade was underway. Police Chief Michael Harrison said the suspect, who was driving a pickup truck that hit two cars before running into the crowd, appeared to be highly intoxicated. Among the injured, the youngest is 3 and the oldest are in their 40s. None of the injuries was   officials said.

It is also the only parade to roll on a route from   to downtown New Orleans,” reported NOLA. com. The annual parade is marked by its massive floats, many decorated with neon lettering, large and glowing    big video screens and even spotlights shooting into the sky.  The size of the floats allows hundreds of people to ride on some of them, and the riders    some dressed in tuxedos, others wearing masks and costumes    continually toss beads and necklaces to the thick crowd. Mardi Gras, French for ”Fat Tuesday,” is a day of revelry that includes parades, parties and gastronomic indulgence before the Christian fasting season of Lent begins on Ash Wednesday. It marks the last day of the Carnival season. Mardi Gras has also come to refer to the weekend of parties and celebrations immediately preceding Lent. The day is also called Shrove Tuesday, Carnival Tuesday or Pancake Tuesday, depending on where the celebration is taking place.",0
"WASHINGTON  —   The Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily blocked a court order that had allowed a transgender boy to use the boys’ bathroom in a Virginia high school. The vote was 5 to 3, with Justice Stephen G. Breyer joining the court’s more conservative members “as a courtesy. ” He said that this would preserve the status quo until the court decided whether to hear the case. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented. The court’s order has no effect on any other case. The move came amid a national debate over transgender rights. A North Carolina law that requires transgender people to use bathrooms in government buildings that correspond with the gender listed on their birth certificates has drawn protests, boycotts and lawsuits. A directive from the Obama administration threatening schools with the loss of federal money for discrimination based on gender identity has been challenged in court by more than 20 states. The case in the Supreme Court concerns Gavin Grimm, who was born female but identifies as a male and will soon start his senior year at Gloucester High School in southeastern Virginia. For a time, school administrators allowed Mr. Grimm to use the boys’ bathroom, but the local school board adopted a policy that required students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms for their “corresponding biological genders. ” The board added that “students with gender identity issues” would be allowed to use private bathrooms. Mr. Grimm sued, and a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va. ruled the policy unlawful. A trial judge then ordered school officials to let Mr. Grimm use the boys’ bathroom. The school board has said that it will file a petition in late August asking the Supreme Court to hear its appeal. In the meantime, the board submitted an emergency application that asked the justices to let school officials continue to bar Mr. Grimm from the boys’ bathroom. The alternative, the board’s lawyers said, was harm to “the basic expectations of bodily privacy” and “severe disruption to the school in the upcoming school year. ” The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Mr. Grimm, responded that the trial court’s order did not amount to the kind of irreparable harm that warrants a stay from the Supreme Court, as it concerned a single student in a single high school which has taken steps to increase privacy in restrooms for all students. The legal question in the case, Gloucester County School Board v. G. G. No. 16A52, is whether the Obama administration was entitled to interpret a regulation under Title IX, a 1972 law that bans discrimination “on the basis of sex” in schools that receive federal money, to ban discrimination based on gender identity. The regulation, adopted in 1975, allowed schools to provide “separate toilet, locker rooms and shower facilities on the basis of sex. ” Last year, the federal Department of Education weighed in on the Gloucester School Board’s policy, saying schools “generally must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity. ” In May, the department issued a more general directive that said schools may lose federal money if they discriminate against transgender students. The Fourth Circuit said the 1975 regulation was ambiguous and that the department’s interpretation of it was entitled to “controlling weight. ” Under a 1997 Supreme Court decision, Auer v. Robbins, agencies’ interpretations of their own regulations are generally entitled to deference. The Auer decision has been the subject of much criticism, and several justices have urged the Supreme Court to revisit the ruling. In a dissent in May, Justice Clarence Thomas said it was “on its last gasp. ”",0
"Trinh Thi Ngo, a   radio announcer known as Hanoi Hannah who entertained American forces during the Vietnam War while trying to persuade them that the conflict was immoral, died on Friday in Ho Chi Minh City. She was believed to be 85. Nguyen Ngoc Thuy, a former colleague of Mrs. Ngo’s at Voice of Vietnam, the state broadcaster where she worked for decades, confirmed her death in a telephone interview on Tuesday and said she had been treated for liver ailments. Mrs. Ngo, who broadcast in English, was a propaganda weapon for North Vietnam as it battled the United States and the South Vietnamese government. Her work was in the tradition of Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally, whose radio broadcasts were intended to damage the morale of American troops during World War II. Mr. Thuy said that Mrs. Ngo was both a national celebrity and a role model to her younger colleagues, including himself. “We admired her perfect voice and her legendary role” in the war effort, he said in the interview. Mrs. Ngo was born in Hanoi, the capital, in 1931, when Vietnam was a French colony. (Her exact birth date could not be learned, nor was there information on survivors.) She learned English from private tutors in the early 1950s  —   partly, she later recalled, because she loved watching Hollywood films like “Gone With the Wind. ” “I always preferred American movies to French films,” she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1994. “The French talked too much. There was more action in American movies. ’’ Mrs. Ngo began broadcasting for Voice of Vietnam in 1955, a year after Vietnamese revolutionaries defeated France at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, forcing the French from Indochina. Early in her career she used the name Thu Huong, or Autumn Fragrance, because it was easier for her   listeners to pronounce, she told The Times. “Fewer syllables,” she said. Her broadcasts aimed at United States forces began in 1965, and she was still on the air in 1975, when North Vietnam captured Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital, and renamed it Ho Chi Minh City. As part of her programs, each 30 minutes long, Mrs. Ngo would announce the names of American soldiers who had died in battle the previous month. Her listeners included the Navy pilot John McCain, the future United States senator, who was a prisoner of war in Hanoi for five and a half years after his plane was shot down in October 1967. On a visit to Hanoi in April 2000, Senator McCain said he had listened to Mrs. Ngo’s broadcasts on loudspeakers that hung from the ceiling in a cellblock illuminated by a single bulb. “I heard her every day,” he said. “She’s a marvelous entertainer. I’m surprised she didn’t get to Hollywood. ” Mrs. Ngo’s broadcasts included music by Pete Seeger, Joan Baez and other antiwar American folk singers, and she took a friendly approach to her listeners, Mr. Thuy said. But beneath her gentle tone, he added, was a steely confidence in the North Vietnamese cause. Nguyen Van Vinh, a Vietnamese cameraman who filmed Mrs. Ngo’s meeting the actress and antiwar activist Jane Fonda in Hanoi in 1972, said Mrs. Ngo had “talked in a whisper to the G. I. s. ” “Soldiers used a gun, but in Hanoi, in North Vietnam, she used her voice,” he said. Mrs. Ngo acknowledged as much in the 1994 interview with The Times. “My work was to make the G. I. s understand that it was not right for them to take part in this war,” she said. “I talk to them about the traditions of the Vietnamese, to resist aggression. I want them to know the truth about this war and to do a little bit to demoralize them so that they will refuse to fight. ” She said the Americans had called her Hanoi Hannah for a simple reason: alliteration. “The Americans like nicknames,” she added.",0
"The musicians of the fabled Philadelphia Orchestra went on strike on Friday just before their   gala concert, rattling the classical music world and silencing one of the nation’s great ensembles a little more than four years after it emerged from bankruptcy. The strike  —   called on the same day that musicians on the other side of Pennsylvania at the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra walked out on strike  —   came as the Philadelphia’s players sought to recover some of the pay they lost to concessions during the recent bankruptcy. As a gala audience including many of the Philadelphia Orchestra’s donors and board members, some in black tie, gathered at Verizon Hall for an opening night concert that was supposed to be conducted by the orchestra’s popular music director, Yannick   a series of   talks were held in an effort to avert the strike. But they proved fruitless, and the musicians were soon walking a picket line instead of playing Gershwin and Ravel. The strike was the biggest shock wave yet in a tumultuous autumn for symphony orchestras, at a time when many are grappling with fiscal challenges. Now Philadelphia, the Pittsburgh Symphony, and the smaller Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra are all on strike. At the same time other orchestras, like the San Francisco Symphony, have agreed to   pay deals. The Philadelphia Orchestra, one of America’s “big five” orchestras, is known for its plush Philadelphia sound, and for a high caliber of   under leaders including Leopold Stokowski, Eugene Ormandy, Riccardo Muti, and now Mr.   who was recently named the next music director of the Metropolitan Opera. “We can no longer remain silent while we continue in a downward spiral,” the musicians said in a statement. They noted that their pay had been cut in recent years, including a 14 percent cut in 2011, and that they now make less than musicians in the nation’s other leading orchestras. John Koen, a cellist who is chairman of the orchestra’s negotiating committee, said, “We did everything we could to save this concert,” but that the two sides remained too far apart on pay. The orchestra’s management said it had offered the musicians raises of 2 percent each year for the next three years on an annual base pay of $127, 608, which is less than other top orchestras pay. Allison Vulgamore, the president and chief executive of the orchestra, told the audience that the concert had been canceled. She said in a statement that the cancellation was “naturally disappointing to all of us” and added that “even as our last several years have seen us overcome numerous challenges, we hope this, too, will soon lead to a mutually satisfactory agreement. ” Outside the hall, musicians marched carrying signs saying “Philadelphia Orchestra on Strike” and “Retain the Artistry. ” A small group of the orchestra’s brass players gave a brief impromptu concert on the sidewalk to console disappointed concertgoers. As he left the hall, Tim Szczesny, 24, said that he had driven three hours from Binghamton, N. Y. to attend the concert and had come away disappointed. “We tried to do something nice tonight and it backfired,” said Mr. Szczesny, who was with his girlfriend, Pamela Blatkiewicz, 23, who lives in Philadelphia. Mr. Szczesny said he didn’t know whom to blame for the concert cancellation but he believed   musicians should be fairly compensated. “It does seem kind of sad that they can’t reach agreement,” he said. “These musicians are world renowned. ” Deborah Ledley, a resident of Penn Valley, in the Philadelphia suburbs, was downcast about the strike. “It’s so sad,” she said. “I love the orchestra, and they couldn’t play on opening night. ” A small gala dinner in the hall went on as planned after the concert was canceled.",0
"Two books by one of Sweden’s most popular and decorated children’s authors may be withdrawn from circulation after an “investigation” revealed that they contained “stereotypical depictions of other cultures”. Jan Lööf was issued with an ultimatum: redraw the pictures, or have the books withdrawn. [The books in question are incredibly popular, and one  —   Catch Fabian  —   is sold out and will not be restocked, while publisher Bonnier Carlsen have withdrawn all 5, 000 copies of the other  —   Grandpa is a Pirate  —    from sale. “They have given me an ultimatum. I either have to redraw the pictures or the books will not be published anymore,” the author told the newspaper Dagens Nyheter.   Grandpa is a Pirate, first published in 1966, is considered an integral part of children’s literature in Sweden,  has having been translated into several languages and have even been distributed at McDonalds.   On Bokus. com, which lists the most popular books for each age range, Grandpa is a Pirate is at number three  —   but unlike the other books listed on the website, “buy” is no longer an option. The objections the publishers have are that its main character meets a street seller named Abdullah and an evil pirate named Omar, pictured in the tweet below: Varning för ’Morfar är sjörövare’  —   med bilder på ”Omar och hans arabiska sjörövare”. #svpol #pippigate #bokbål pic. twitter.   —   Inte naiv, men  …     (@Inte_Naiv_Men) September 30, 2014,  In discussions with the publisher over Catch Fabian, Mr Lööf was asked to   illustrations the publisher deemed problematic, including: “the image of jazz musicians performing” and “that somebody wore sunglasses to go to bed”. He attempted some sketches, which were then deemed “not good enough”. Mr Lööf told the publisher that he had realised the task was “not possible” and subsequently was told that they would have to be put out of print. The publisher’s spokeswoman categorically denied being “too afraid” to portray “uncomfortable topics” saying instead that the decision to withdraw Grandpa is a Pirate was about “awareness and respectfulness to our younger readers”. “For us, Jan and his writing is incredibly important,” the representative said. But apparently not as important as the “current debate” which is about “how, in a respectful manner, we take into account contemporary values and at the same time cultural heritage”. If this were true then Bonnier Carlsen would have welcomed the book as it illustrates a the rarely portrayed but hugely historical role that Arabs played in the days of high piracy, as well as being a part of (now often forgotten) Swedish history: Sweden joining America in her first overseas war, which was fought  against Barbary pirates.  Barbary pirates, from four North African states known as the “Barbary States” kidnapped American crews for ransom money, and kidnapped and enslaved more than one million Europeans, which prompted the two countries into war with the Barbary States. Mr Lööf received the Schullströmska prize, which is awarded by the Swedish Academy every two years to an “outstanding writer of children’s books” just last month. Previously he has been decorated with both the Lagerlöf Literature Prize and the Astrid Lindgren Prize, but the author says he will not be changing his books, saying: “I’m 76 years old and can not be bothered to change. This is not about the money. But, I probably will not be doing any more books for children”. The Local reported that: “There has been general support for Lööf on Sweden’s social media channels, with many social media users questioning whether censorship has gone too far”. Having examined all recent tweets with the relevant hashtag, of 18 tweets referencing the controversy 16 strongly opposed the censorship.",0
"Last April, the Brandeis University student paper The Justice covered an   march known as “Take Back the Night,” an ongoing even that has taken place at Brandeis since 2005. Unfortunately for the writing team at the paper, they didn’t know that they were stepping into a minefield. [Shortly after the piece was published, comments came into the story claiming that by anonymously quoting survivors of sexual assault, the writers were only further abusing those victims. Abby Patkin, a news editor who covered the march, told The College Fix that they “heard from several critics  …     that [they] were taking away the survivors autonomy over their stories, that they weren’t [theirs] to tell. ”  Other criticisms placed on the reporters were that the march was a “safe space,” and by covering it, the journalists violated that concept. Thankfully, other commenters highlighted that the event was in a public space and that the paper was well within their rights under the First Amendment to cover said story.    Max Moran said that the   quotes were published “because at its heart, Take Back the Night is about survivors sharing these experiences, and in our view, any coverage that does not address that is fundamentally failing to capture what the event is about. ” The attacks on the paper only escalated. Four months later in August 2015, a law firm which allegedly represented two students at the event sent The Justice a letter, demanding that the article be taken down from their site and the paper issue an apology, under the threat of legal action. The shaky grounds on which this claim was staked is that the paper allegedly violated Massachusetts law by recording the audio of the event, as it was in a public location, even though the audio was immediately deleted after the reporter had finished transcribing it. Thankfully for The Justice, the paper never heard from the lawyers after that first letter. Brandeis finally weighed in on the controversy this February  —   10 months after the initial event. Avi Gold, the managing editor at the paper, received a letter alleging that he violated the “Electronic Devices and Privacy” policy of the university. This   policy bans students from “using electronic devices in any manner that invades or causes disruption to another individual’s privacy in a classroom, library or other campus facility or at any campus event. ” As is the norm with bureaucratic university   it failed to define either “invades” or “disruption,” nor did it mention whether public campus events were exempt. At this point, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) decided to intervene. FIRE’s March 23rd letter to interim President Lisa Lynch highlighted that the school was incorrect in saying that Patkin’s recording violated state law, as her phone was “in plain view” whilst recording and in no way could be described as “secret,” the key point needed to contravene the legislation. FIRE threatened to “use all of the resources at our disposal to see this matter through to a just conclusion. ” Only 5 days later, Gold received a letter from Kerry Guerard, director of student rights and community standards at Brandeis, declaring that the investigation was ending, and that the university would review its recording policy and “consider revisions” of the code. At the end of this, it seems that the real victims of this attempted censorship were those survivors themselves. In the “Take Back the Night” event held last week, no survivor came forward to share their stories, prompting organizers to share generic stories from the national website and discuss statistics on sexual assault.

" (CNN) It appears that the Malaysian government has not learned from its mistakes.   For Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to announce that the debris found on Reunion Island conclusively belongs to MH370, when French authorities directly involved with the inspection of the debris in question    a    are calling the discovery a good supposition, is reckless.  This is not about semantics.  This is about responsibility.  Allow me to step out of the airline pilot box for a moment.  Discussing the investigative analysis of the flaperon, a flight control surface,  and how this inspection relates to the impact of the 777 with the water has been well discussed both on air and on this website.  I can’t add anything further that hasn’t already been covered.  But I can help with the understanding of the human aspect of the accident investigation process. MH370: Window, seat cushion parts have washed up, Malaysia says, First, for all intents and purposes, the aircraft part found has a high likelihood of belonging to MH370.  Boeing has said that the part is a flaperon from a 777.  If it’s from a 777, then it’s from MH370.  There are no other   airplanes of this type in the world.  The additional parts and pieces discovered after the flaperon    well, the jury is still out on those items. Now to the human element of accident investigation:  Through my pilots union and the cooperation of my airline, I have been trained in critical incident stress management: CISM.  My involvement with CISM has included various incidents and accidents, with the most memorable a crash in Rockaway, New York, in November of 2001.   I spent many hours among the devastation. The experience was a tremendous lesson.  No two people exposed to such trauma are affected in exactly the same way.  One person’s perception is another person’s reality. And that perception is very important to the families of the 239 souls lost with MH370.  Because of the difficulty in processing such a catastrophic event, rational thought often goes out the window.  If a history of misinformation has been established, this only adds to the trauma.  Mistrust and anger become natural parts of the emotional reaction.  This is normal. That is why it is of the utmost importance to only release established facts during the investigation process.  Speculation from outside sources will always occur, but at least the credibility of the accident investigation team will remain intact.  The best example of a textbook investigation process on properly disseminating information to the public was the crash of Asiana Flight 214 in San Francisco.  I give former NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman high marks.  Most accidents are processed immediately.  An airplane crashes.  Some passengers survive.  Some passengers die.  But with MH370, for over 500 days, there was no concrete proof.  Now, in the form of a flaperon, we have proof. Unfortunately for the families of the victims, this evidence   emotional wounds.  Yes, the world is   anticipating that the mystery will be unraveled    but the investigative process will still take time.  Even if the search teams found the main wreckage today, it may take years to fully analyze the data.  A statement of probable cause will require methodical research, especially considering the unusual circumstances of MH370. MH370 family member: ’I can’t speak’ It is certainly important to maintain our optimism that we will find the cause of the mysterious disappearance, but let’s not lose sight of the fact investigations take time.  For the sake of the families, it is my hope that the governments involved get their act together.  Communicate the facts only.  And if this means withholding information from the media for a period of time, so be it.   More coverage on MH370,   Join us on Facebook. . Read CNNOpinion’s Flipboard magazine. ",0
"Retired Secret Service officer Gary Byrne’s explosive   on Hillary Rodham Clinton and former President Bill Clinton from his days inside the White House has topped the New York Times bestseller list for the end of June, despite a   media blackout. [“I am very grateful to the tens of thousands of Americans who have bought my book and listened to my message,” Byrne said in a statement obtained exclusively by Breitbart News ahead of its public release. “But I would welcome the opportunity to reach a larger audience.  Today I urge the mainstream media networks who so far have declined to give a voice to my message and the serious allegations I have raised to reconsider their positions, both in the interest of fairness and out of a sense of obligation to the American public. ”  Byrne’s   book, Crisis of Character, has also been the number one nonfiction book on Amazon for about a month as well. In addition, sources say, Byrne’s book was the bestselling nonfiction book at Barnes and Noble last week. In it, Byrne —  who stood guard outside Bill Clinton’s oval office for three years in the 1990s —  exposes, among other things,    details on how Hillary Clinton, then the First Lady, regularly lost control of herself engaging in rage fits laden with expletives she shouted at Secret Service officers. Because of the fact that Byrne —  despite a glowing history ringing with praise from even Bill Clinton’s appointees and his senior staff —  exposes so much about the Clintons, the mainstream media has blacked him out. But coverage from new media like The Drudge Report and Breitbart News among others has skyrocketed Byrne’s book to the top of sales across America. Donald Trump, the presumptive 2016 GOP presidential nominee, has also hyped the book as proof that Hillary Clinton —  unlike her husband —  does not have the temperament to be president of the United States. What’s worse is despite the intense popularity and interest from Americans —  as evidenced by the fact the book is selling at the top of almost all charts amid an intense election year —  the entire mainstream media and all the major networks have barred their reporters and anchors from covering the book because Hillary Clinton doesn’t like what Gary Byrne exposes.  The Drudge Report, in a recent rare and high profile exclusive, reported that “Hillary’s campaign has won assurances that he will not be invited to spread ‘lies’ on any of the nation’s broadcast networks. ” One Hillary Clinton campaign official, according to The Drudge Report exclusive, even warned a television network producer that Byrne’s book is “trash for cash. ” Byrne’s agents, in the press release announcing The New York Times number one bestseller position, despite the media blackout, which was provided to Breitbart News ahead of its public release, detailed how the book reached the top of the prestigious list for the week of June 27. “In CRISIS OF CHARACTER, Byrne, an Air Force veteran with a nearly   federal law enforcement career, gives a   eyewitness account of the scandal and turmoil that characterized the first Clinton White House, embroiled the nation in a historic impeachment crisis, and which he believes will   if the Clintons return to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,” the release reads. “Byrne’s book takes direct aim at the ‘dangerous’ temperament of presumptive Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton. ” The release also notes that every mainstream media outlet in America has ignored or “shunned” the book.  “The author has bemoaned that the book, despite its direct relevance to the 2016 campaign, has been shunned by every mainstream media outlet,” the release reads. “News outlets across the board including ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN have so far declined to welcome the author onto their programs for a chance to share his views. ”",0
"Japanese polling firms found solid support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to Florida this past weekend to spend time with his American counterpart, President Donald Trump, though   politicians condemned expanding U. S.  ties. [The newswire service Kyodo published a poll following Abe’s return to Japan finding that 70 percent of Japanese respondents were “satisfied” with Abe’s visit to the White House and Trump’s estate in Florida,   . The New York Times adds that the Kyodo poll found approval of Abe’s work as prime minister generally to be 62 percent, a slight uptick from a month earlier.  The Japanese broadcaster NHK found similar results. NHK’s polls found that 68 percent of Japanese respondents either “somewhat” or “highly” approved of Abe’s time in the United States. Only 27 percent said they either “somewhat” or “highly” disapprove of the visit.   percent said they approved of the job that Abe’s cabinet is doing, three percent more than those who said so in January. Abe arrived from Tokyo on Friday and engaged in a   meeting with President Trump at the White House, followed by a press conference. The two then flew to Florida, where they spent much of the weekend playing golf and getting to know each other. Abe had reportedly suggested the game to Trump, noting that his grandfather, Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, once played a round of golf with Dwight Eisenhower. The two first ladies, Melania Trump and Akie Abe, also spent Saturday together, visiting Florida’s Morikami Museum. Trump and Abe discussed their relationship in two press conferences, as well, with Trump telling reporters, “The United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent. ” “President Trump has just made it clear in our leaders’ summit that the United States is with Japan 100 percent at all times, and he is standing next to me right now in order to demonstrate that will,” Abe said. The two also condemned a North Korean missile launch seemingly timed to correspond with their meeting. While most in Japan appear pleased with the bilateral meeting, opposition members have used the meeting to condemn Abe for not opposing Trump policies openly  —   or, in some cases, merely for being too supportive of the United States. The leader of the mainstream opposition Democratic Party, for example, condemned Abe for not issuing a statement opposing President Trump’s executive order limiting immigration from   countries: “With the harsh attention focused on the issue, the sight of the Japanese prime minister happily enjoying golf is not something we can be proud of. ” Japanese Communist Party leader Kazuo Shii, meanwhile, accused Abe of “kowtowing to Trump” by not addressing the refugee issue. Shii’s comments echoed protests from Chinese Communist Party newspaper the People’s Daily, which published an editorial accusing Abe of “fetishizing” the relationship with the United States. Should Abe have chosen to criticize the executive order, he would have likely triggered similar condemnation for Japan’s refugee policy. Japan accepted 0. 26 percent of foreigners applying for refugee status in 2016: 28 people, none from Islamic   Syria or Iraq, but from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Africa. In 2015, the nation accepted 27 refugees. Upon being accepted, the government pays for Japanese lessons for refugees. Challenged on these small refugee application rates in 2015, Abe argued that Japan is not yet fit to accept refugees because of the many social problems facing native Japanese people. “I would say that before accepting immigrants or refugees, we need to have more activities by women, elderly people and we must raise our birth rate. There are many things that we should do before accepting immigrants,” he said in a speech announcing a new   aid package for the Middle East.",0
"Washington (CNN) A new trade deal will allow US beef and natural gas exports to flow into China while opening up the US market for cooked poultry and Chinese banks, the US Commerce Secretary announced Thursday. The initial slate of commitments from the two countries marked the first sign of progress on the   action plan that President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping called for during their meeting at Trump’s Florida estate last month. Trump made renegotiating trade terms between the United States and China a key plank of his presidential campaign, and said last month he hoped to make progress with China in the short term. Under the agreement, China will allow US beef exports to flow directly to the country for the first time since 2003, while the United States will take steps to authorize Chinese imports of cooked poultry into the United States by July 16. The United States and China also agreed to open up US exports of liquefied natural gas to China, which could be a boon for both countries. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the initial agreement, which would also open up the Chinese market to US electronic payment services companies and help Chinese banks gain broader access to the US financial market, would help ”bring down” the US trade deficit with China, though he did not provide a precise estimate. Trump railed against that deficit during his campaign and vowed to reduce it as President. While he floated drastic measures like imposing a tariff on Chinese imports, Trump has instead favored bilateral negotiations thus far. The President hailed the agreement Friday, tweeting, ”China just agreed that the U. S. will be allowed to sell beef, and other major products, into China once again. This is REAL news!” Positive step, Ross called the agreement a ”herculean accomplishment” and argued the deal represented the biggest accomplishment in   trade negotiations ”in the whole history of   relations.” Joshua Meltzer, a senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, called Ross’s characterization ”an overstatement, to put it mildly,” but said the agreement marked a positive initial step to come out of the renewed   comprehensive economic dialogue. The agreement could mark new opportunities for the US agricultural, energy and financial sectors, which have often struggled for market access in China, Meltzer said. But he noted that China has ”made a lot of positive commitments that it hasn’t followed through on” in the past. ”It remains to be seen how much of these turn into real market access,” Meltzerd said. No ’quid pro quo’ Trump signed off on the agreement following weeks of discussions that he delegated to his secretaries of Commerce and Treasury, which Ross said took place ”mostly at very inconvenient hours” owing to the   time difference between the two countries. Throughout the negotiations, Ross said Trump was briefed ”more or less every single day” on the progress of the negotiations. While Trump has said that he was willing to agree to less favorable trade terms for the United States in trade negotiations with China in order to enlist China’ support in stopping North Korea’s aggressive nuclear and ballistic missiles programs, Ross said there was no ”quid pro quo in these discussions.” Ross acknowledged that there are hundreds of issues that still need to be resolved between the United States and China. US companies still complain of high barriers to entry to the Chinese market, while Chinese companies have hurt US manufacturers in part as a result of government support. The United States in recent months has also launched a series of studies and investigations into foreign trade abuses and the impact of certain exports on specific US industries, several of which are directed at Chinese actions.",0
" (CNN) Senate negotiators announced Tuesday that they had reached a tentative agreement on a     bill to fund highway construction ahead of a deadline at the end of the month when the current funding expires. But Senate Democrats blocked taking up the agreement right away so they could have additional time to study the deal. Quick passage of the agreement is also complicated by a pair of unrelated but contentious issues two Republican presidential candidates want to debate as part of the bill    funding for Planned Parenthood and the   Bank. ”Senators from both parties know that a   highway bill is in the best interest of our country. So we’ll continue working together to get a good one passed,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor about the agreement he had struck with Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, the top Democrat on the public works committee. RELATED: Second Planned Parenthood video surfaces showing alleged selling of fetal tissue, Boxer called the agreement a ”breakthrough” but details of the deal    including how it would be funded    were not released until after a procedural vote to begin debate was initially scheduled.  In fact, Democrats voted to block starting debate until they had time to pour through the   bill that provides funding for highways, bridges and other infrastructure projects and that also includes thorny transportation policy changes that have been difficult to resolve. ”We have a few rules that we follow,” Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said after meeting behind   with other Democratic senators.  ”One is that we should actually be able to see the bill and read it and discuss it before we’re asked to vote on it.” Democrats couldn’t say how much time they would need to study the 1030 page bill before beginning formal debate but McConnell said he hoped to vote again Wednesday to begin debate. If senators get on the bill, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky wants to offer an amendment blocking funding for Planned Parenthood, after a controversial video surfaced last week showing an executive with the organization discussing the use of fetal tissue from abortions for medical research.  RELATED: Second Planned Parenthood video surfaces showing alleged selling of fetal tissue, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas wants to block an amendment by supporters of the recently expired   Bank, who are trying to revive the   institution that makes loans to companies overseas to buy American products.   Cruz and other conservatives see it as a government handout from a bank they see as corrupt. McConnell has promised bank supporters they could get an amendment vote on the highway bill and it’s expected to have more than 60 supporters. Both Paul and Cruz have pledged to go to the mat on their respective issues so it’s unclear how long it will take to work through the bill. If the Senate passes the bill, it’s unlikely the House, which passed a substantially different highway bill, would quickly accept it. That means the two chambers would probably agree on a short term bill to keep road projects funded until after the August congressional recess. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy urged the Senate to pass the extension of the highway program that the House approved recently, which authorizes spending for roads and bridges through  . ”I think the Senate should take up our short term bill as is and pass that,” he said. McCarthy told reporters he was withholding judgment on the Senate deal, but said he preferred a long term package that fully paid for the program.  But McConnell said late Tuesday he hoped that the House would be happy with the bipartisan bill the Senate is working on and consider passing it before leaving town for the August recess. McConnell also threatened to have lawmakers work this weekend in order to speed Senate passage. ",0
"Films centered on faith and the messages of Jesus Christ need to feel like epic summer blockbusters in order to attract younger, secular audiences who wouldn’t otherwise be interested,   Mark Burnett told Breitbart News at a recent press event for his upcoming reimagining of  . [In addition to spearheading groundbreaking reality television series like Survivor and The Apprentice, Burnett and his wife and business partner Roma Downey have produced     hits like the 2013 miniseries The Bible, its   A. D.: The Bible Continues and feature films like Son of God.  Of the pair’s upcoming    —   based on Lew Wallace’s 1880 novel  : A Tale of the Christ, not a remake of the 1959 Charlton    —   Burnett said it was important that the film, due out August 19, feel like an   summer blockbuster rather than the kind of smaller film that   companies have released in recent years. “Part of what causes the enormity of the budget are the special effects and the experience of 3D that young audiences are expecting,” Burnett said, without divulging the exact budget for   (reported to be close to $100 million). “From a Christian audience perspective, it’s very important to make content that would stand on its own, whether it was   or not,” Burnett continued. “It needs to stand alone and be high quality to attract a wide audience. And if it happens to also have a message of forgiveness and love and redemption and the story of Jesus woven in, that’s actually the right approach. Because you can’t be expecting young, secular Americans to be attracted to watch a movie that doesn’t have the right trailer and the feeling that it’s a big, exciting summer action movie. Because remember what you’re up against, look at the slate of the summer. People have only got so much money to go to so many movies. And so you’ve got to offer something pretty epic. ” Adds Downey: “I think there’s such an opportunity for this story to reach young people, and  —   through this   movie  —   bring them to the story of Jesus, bring them to the foot of the Cross. ”   stars Jack Huston (Boardwalk Empire) as Judah   a Jewish prince who is falsely accused of treason and exiled by his adopted brother Messala (Toby Kebbell) who has become a   officer in the Roman army. After years of brutal slavery and aided by the enigmatic horse trainer Ilderim (Morgan Freeman)   returns to his homeland to seek revenge, and ultimately, redemption. The character of Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro) plays a much more prominent role in this film, as opposed to the 1959 iteration in which the character was seen in key moments, but never spoke. “There’s a little bit more freedom in this story, because the story of   is a fictional story, although woven through it are important moments,   moments for [Judah  ] when he encounters Jesus Christ,” Downey said. “And ultimately, through grace, he is transformed, and his life is changed. ” Burnett was named president of MGM Television in December of last year, and Downey is set to launch a new faith and   channel for the company later this year that will reportedly include original programming as well as episodes of hit family television series like Little House on the Prairie and Touched by an Angel. “I think we do really well together, considering we spend more time together than most people do. And we often joke, but it really is true, that it’s a miracle that we’re still speaking to each other,” Downey explained of how the power couple balance their professional obligations with their private lives. “My girlfriends always say to me, ‘I couldn’t even do yard work with my husband!’ But we do well. We have respect for each other and we love what we do. ”   is in theaters August 19.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum,  ",0
" (CNN) A former terror suspect with a ”long record of violence” took a sex worker hostage in a suburban Australian apartment building Monday, in what police say may have been an attempt to lure law enforcement to a gunfight. One man was killed, and three police officers injured, as a result of the hostage standoff in the Melbourne suburb of Brighton, which ended after the attacker    since named as    Yacub Khayre    was shot dead by police. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told reporters Tuesday the attack was being treated as a terrorist incident, saying it had ”shocked all Australians.” ”This terrorist attack by a known criminal, a man who was only recently released on parole, is a shocking, cowardly crime. It is a terrorist attack and it underlines the need for us to be constantly vigilant,” he said. Turnbull said Khayre had been previously known to police, and had links to extremist organizations. ”He had a long record of violence, a very long record of violence, he had been charged with a terrorist offense . .. and acquitted. He was known to have connections, at least in the past, with violent extremism,” he said. Police said they were aware of a claim from ISIS that one of its ”soldiers” carried out the attack. ISIS issued the claim through its Amaq News Agency in Arabic and English. ”It will form part of the investigation,” Victoria Police senior media officer Natalie Webster said.  Attacker may have baited police, The incident began Monday afternoon when    Yacub Khayre called a sex worker to a serviced apartment building in the affluent Melbourne suburb, Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton told reporters. Once Khayre arrived at the apartments, he killed the      concierge with a shotgun and took the female sex worker hostage, calling police to say they shouldn’t try to intervene. Large numbers of police soon arrived on the scene at about 4 p. m. local time, Ashton said, including   teams. After two hours, the man burst out of the apartment and began firing at police, hitting three of them. He was quickly gunned down by law enforcement authorities. Ashton said it was possible Khayre had taken the woman hostage to try and lure as many police as possible to the apartment. ”We still don’t know exactly whether that was the case . .. it’s early, early days,” he said. The commissioner confirmed that during the raid Khayre had called   Channel 7 News to say he dedicated his attack to ISIS and  . ”We believe that calls (were) made by the individual inside the apartment,” Ashton said. ISIS provided no evidence to their claim of responsibility in the Melbourne attack and Ashton said there was no indication that any wider network was involved in Monday’s shooting. ”He was acting alone,” he said. Khayre was on parole, Both Turnbull and Ashton confirmed Khayre was known to police and had been released on parole at the time of the attack. ”(There is) a whole range of offending going back many years, most recently he’s done prison time in relation to reckless intentionally causing injury,” Ashton said. ”Ultimately he’s been qualified on parole and was on parole at the time of this offense.” Khayre’s home in the Melbourne suburb of Roxburgh Park, where he lived with his mother, was being searched by police on Tuesday.  Brighton is a suburban area in eastern Melbourne, known for its affluent residents and close proximity to the beaches of Port Philip Bay. Police were called to the scene after emergency calls reported loud bangs or explosions, Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Andrew Crisp said Monday, which were later confirmed to be a shotgun blast. The woman who had been held hostage was released and was unharmed, Ashton said, while Crisp confirmed the three officers’ injuries were not  .",0
"Individuals who have been hired to be a part of the Justice Department team investigating Russian influence in the U. S. 2016 presidential election have made thousands of dollars in donations to Democrat political campaigns. [Three members of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team made the donations to Democrats, including to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, according to a CNN analysis using Federal Election Commission records. CNN reported:  More than half of the more than $56, 000 came from just one lawyer and more than half of it was donated before the 2016 election, but two of the lawyers gave the maximum $2, 700 donation to Hillary Clinton last year. Over the weekend, news outlets including CNN identified five attorneys that Mueller has already brought on board to help investigate potential collusion between associates of President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia. The attorneys on the team have worked on other   cases, including Watergate and the Enron fraud scandal, as well as representing U. S. companies in legal dealings, according to CNN. Three of the five lawyers gave overwhelmingly to Democrats, totaling more than $53, 000 since 1988, and more than half of those donations came from just one lawyer, James Quarles, who works at the same firm where Mueller worked, WilmerHale. Quarles gave nearly $33, 000 to political campaigns, including presidential candidates Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton. Quarles also gave more than $10, 000 to help Democrats running for the House and another $10, 000 to candidates running for Senate seats, including money to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, CNN reported. Ironically, Quarles is also the only lawyer among Mueller’s team who donated to Republicans, giving $2, 500 to Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( ) in 2015 and $250 to  . George Allen ( ) back in 2005. Only about 30 percent of the donations were for 2016 elections, according to CNN, including Quarles’s and Jeannie Rhee’s, who both gave the maximum $2, 700 contribution to Clinton’s campaign last year. Rhee has donated more than $16, 000 since 2008, all to Democrats, including the maximum allowed contribution to the Clinton campaign in 2016 and 2015, totaling $5, 400. She also gave $7, 300 to both of Obama’s presidential campaigns. Perhaps more importantly, Rhee has already been in the spotlight for representing the Clinton Foundation in a racketeering lawsuit brought by a conservative advocacy group, and also representing Clinton herself in a lawsuit seeking access to her private emails. Mueller, who was FBI director under by President George W. Bush, also hired Andrew Weissmann, who led the Enron investigation, gave $2, 300 to Obama’s first presidential campaign in 2008, and $2, 000 to the Democratic National Committee in 2006. FEC records do not show any donations by Weissman in the 2016 election cycle, according to CNN. There also are no FEC records for Aaron Zebley, who left WilmerHale to work on the Russia investigation. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who endorsed Trump, said on Monday that Mueller’s team can’t be impartial given their political activism. “Republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair,” Gingrich tweeted. “Look who he is hiring. Check FEC reports. Time to rethink. ” Republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair. Look who he is hiring. check fec reports. Time to rethink.  —   Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) June 12, 2017,  “There aren’t any records of political donations from Mueller himself,” CNN reported. “A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment Monday afternoon about the political donations from his legal team and the criticism some of the team were partisan. ”",0
" (CNN) As they took their seats on a TransAsia Airways flight that crashed in Taipei on Wednesday, Lin   and his young family were looking forward to a vacation on Kinmen, an island in the Taiwan Strait.  Minutes later, Lin was fighting his way out of the plane’s wreckage and searching frantically for his toddler in the shallow, murky waters of the Keelung River. He searched for three minutes before spotting his son’s feet in the water. ”When he pulled him out, he had no heartbeat,” Lin  ’s brother, using his English name Chris Lin, told CNN. ”His lips were blue. There was no sign of life in him.” Lin   didn’t give up, performing CPR on his son. ”He is my only child. I absolutely have to save his life    I can’t lose him,” the Liberty Times newspaper quoted him as saying. The    boy made it and was in a hospital Thursday, about to be discharged from the intensive care unit as he battles pneumonia, his uncle said. Chris Lin said that his brother, Lin   suffered some scratches, while his    fractured some bones and is recovering well after surgery on her left hand. ”My brother was really grateful for the rescue teams (and) the pilot,” said Chris Lin. ”Because of (the pilot’s) heroic act, he was able to save a lot of people    and allow our family to survive.” Chris Lin refuted earlier claims by local media that the Lin family switched seats before takeoff after a noise made his brother uneasy and it was this hunch that saved the family from death.  He told CNN on Monday that his brother and family switched seats at the   desk and not when they were on the plane. Lucky escape, Chris Lin said his brother told him the plane suddenly dropped after its left engine lost power. After it hit the water, Lin      who was strapped to his seat and upside down    unbuckled himself before helping free his wife, the brother said. A fire department rescue worker who was one of the first on the scene said the cabin was already   in water when he entered.  ”Many passengers were tangled up in their seat belts and hung upside down,” the Taipei Times quoted him as saying.  Huang   72, said he helped save four lives by unclipping safety belts. ”Shortly after taking off, I felt something was not right,” he told CNN affiliate ETTV.  ”I thought: ’something’s wrong with the engine,’ because I always take this flight.” Thirteen people were saved in the initial rescue effort but progress slowed and water had completely filled the fuselage by evening, when a crane lifted it from the water.  Taxi driver: ’A plane flew by and hit me’ The Lins were not the only ones to have a lucky escape.  As the    plane spiraled into the river on the outskirts of the island’s capital, it clipped a taxi traveling along an elevated highway. The driver,    Chou   and his female passenger sustained only minor injuries from shattered fragments of windshield glass.  Photographs showed a yellow Volkswagen with a flattened windshield and engine hood.  After the plane hit, the taxi driver made a shocking report to dispatchers. ”I just brought a passenger up unto Huandong, and as I was getting on (the expressway) a plane flew by and hit me,” he said, according to an audio recording of the call released by taxi company Crown Taxi. ”A   model plane?” the dispatcher asked. ”My car is completely wrecked,” Chou replied, going on to explain that it wasn’t a   plane, but a manned plane. ”Huh?” the puzzled dispatcher responded. ”Are there any casualties?” The driver described the dire situation: ”The whole thing fell into the Keelung River. My passenger can’t get out of the vehicle. My car’s wrecked.” According to the Taipei Times, Chou’s family didn’t believe him at first when he telephoned home to say: ”I’m OK. My car got into a crash. It was hit by an airplane.”",0
"Mayor Bill de Blasio posted a video on his City Hall Twitter account on Tuesday that featured two Broadway actors singing his praises and promoting his accomplishments, drawing criticism from government watchdog groups who said that it was an inappropriate use of public money and was too much like a campaign ad. The video, which tries to poke fun at itself even as it promotes the mayor, was posted on the official City Hall Twitter account, @NYCMayor, and features Mr. de Blasio in an awkward thespian effort. It also includes his wife, Chirlane McCray a senior adviser, Andrea Hagelgans and two Broadway stars, Jenna Ushkowitz and James Monroe Iglehart. Ms. Ushkowitz starred in the television show “Glee” and has appeared in Broadway musicals, including “Waitress” and “Spring Awakening. ” Mr. Iglehart won a Tony Award in 2014 for his role as the Genie in “Aladdin. ” The video shows Mr. de Blasio, who is running for   in the coming year, sitting in the back of what appears to be one of the mayoral sport utility vehicles, talking with Ms. McCray on his cellphone. “Hey honey, I really like this song idea,” he says. “I really think it’s the perfect way to wrap up all the great things we’ve done this year. ” Ms. McCray, Ms. Hagelgans and the actors are shown in a room at Gracie Mansion. Ms. McCray puts the mayor on speaker phone so he can listen as the two actors sing, accompanied by a piano player. “In case the folks are unaware, we’ve got some facts we’d like to share,” they sing. They go on to plug mayoral programs like protections for renters, the construction and preservation of affordable housing, and a mental health initiative. “Who’s bringing cops and community close?” Ms. Ushkowitz sings as the beat goes  . “Who’s got incarceration and crime rates sinking to a record low?” The performance closes with a rousing reference to Mr. de Blasio. “No matter what will be, we’ve got Billy D. B. !” Ms. Ushkowitz belts out. The mayor starts out nodding happily to all the praise but then whispers to an aide, “This is kind of over the top. ” In the end, he delivers his review of the performance: “Maybe the song’s a little too elaborate,” he says. “Maybe we should just do a couple of tweets and a Facebook post instead. ” Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog organization, questioned whether creating the video was a justifiable use of public resources and said it raised questions because it came right before next year’s   campaign. “This is a virtual campaign ad that is meant to be a   announcement but goes beyond that in serving to promote the mayor,” Mr. Dadey said. The video is part of a broader effort by City Hall to increase its use of the internet and social media to reach out to New Yorkers directly, bypassing traditional news media. It also comes as Mr. de Blasio controls his interactions with the press, frequently avoiding questions and limiting the news conferences at which he will take questions on any topic to once a week. Eric Phillips, Mr. de Blasio’s press secretary, said that the video was produced by City Hall staff and that the actors volunteered their time. Mr. Phillips said that City Hall spent a total of $700 to pay the piano player and a composer. He said it cost an additional $170 to have the piano tuned and $30 to rent a rehearsal room. Although the mayor is running for   next year, Mr. Phillips said in a written statement that the video “doesn’t have anything to do with his campaign. ” He added, “We think New Yorkers have a right to know what their government does, and it’s our job to communicate that work in a modern way. ” The immediate effect of the video was not exactly the stuff of Broadway hit material. In the first seven hours after the video was posted on Twitter, it had received 218 likes on the mayor’s account and 88 retweets.",0
"In a private speech in 2013, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton reportedly took credit for the liberation of Chinese dissident attorney Chen Guangcheng, calling it “one of those moments where you have to think hard about what America really stands for. ”[Chen later accused Clinton, then Secretary of State, and Washington of “giving in” to the Communist Chinese government and nearly abandoning him when he asked for political asylum.  The excerpt from the speech, allegedly to attendees of the Jewish United Fund Of Metropolitan Chicago Vanguard Luncheon in October 2013, is part of a larger document dump posted online by Wikileaks last week. Wikileaks published a more searchable version of the private speech database on Monday. Over the weekend, Democrats did not affirmatively deny the veracity of the documents in question, but Clinton running mate Tim Kaine told CNN, “I don’t think we can dig in documents dumped by WikiLeaks and just assume they’re all accurate and true. ” He did not elaborate. In the speech in question, Clinton says she had a part in “helping a blind Chinese dissident get safety in the American Embassy in Beijing and then negotiating with the Chinese to get him and his immediate family out of China. ” “That was one of those moments where you have to think hard about what America really stands for so when I got a call late one night saying that Chen Guangcheng had escaped from his house where he had been under house arrest, he’d been picked up by sympathizers and he was on his way to Beijing and he wanted safety in the American Embassy, there were many who said, ‘Don’t do it, we’ll totally destroy our relationship with the Chinese government,’” Wikileaks quotes Clinton as saying. Clinton allegedly made those remarks two years before Chen would write his memoir, The Barefoot Lawyer, about his escape to the United States, but one year before Clinton had published her own memoir, Hard Choices. In that book, Clinton also took credit for freeing Chen, writing that she and other American diplomats did “what Chen said he wanted every step of the way. ” Chen’s version of events in his 2015 differ significantly from Clinton’s. Chen, who worked as an attorney in China defending women the government forced to have abortions as part of its   policy, had been placed on house arrest for years due to his activism. In 2012, he escaped house arrest and fled to a U. S. embassy. There, he demanded political asylum for himself and his family. “No one seemed to be putting pressure on the Chinese Communist Party” Chen wrote of his experience at the embassy, “instead they were dumping shipping containers of weight onto my shoulders to get me to do their bidding. Suddenly I was overcome by sadness and wept. ” “I hadn’t expected so many people on both sides would be working so hard to get me to leave [the embassy] without guaranteeing my rights or my family’s safety,” he added. Of the Obama administration, he wrote in his book, “What troubled me most at the time was this: when negotiating with a government run by hooligans, the country that most consistently advocated for democracy, freedom, and universal human rights had simply given in. ” American officials, he wrote, attempted to pressure him into staying in China under the auspices of a Chinese university, even after being invited by New York University to work on their Shanghai campus. Chen initially agreed to stay in China after what he described as immense pressure, but later recanted and demanded a seat on Hillary Clinton’s flight out of China.

[Kaine’s running mate, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, beat the drum on the lead contamination in Flint, saying in a July campaign statement that “There is no excuse for what’s happening in Flint. ” Clinton professed “outrage” over the situation in Flint during an appearance on the Rachel Maddow Show, yet her own running mate Kaine chose to fundraise instead of serving in his current position in the Senate and voting on the legislation associated with investigating the Flint case and providing funding for other areas that face similar water crises.  Kaine was recorded as “not voting” on Wednesday on a motion to invoke cloture and move forward the Water Resources Development Act Of 2016. Congressional summary of S. 2848 states: Additional assistance is provided to states with emergency public health threats associated with lead or other contaminants in a public drinking water supply system. The Department of Justice and the inspector general of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must report on the status of any ongoing investigations into the government’s response to the drinking water contamination in Flint, Michigan. It would provide additional assistance to states with similar public health threats to public drinking water in the future. Instead of voting on the bill to help protect public drinking water, Kaine chose to raise campaign funds at two events in Chicago, Illinois according to the Chicago Sun Times. One of the events featuring Kaine is at the home of Bill Daley, former chief of staff to President Barack Obama and former commerce secretary for former President Bill Clinton. Daley’s wife Bernadette Keller is hosting along with him as well as Globetrotters Engineering CEO Niranjan Shah and daughter Smita Shah. Both Shahs are major Democratic donors, the elder Shah having financially backed former President Clinton and former Gov. of Illinois Rod Blagojevich, who is now in prison for corruption including trying to sell former Senator Obama’s seat in Congress. Attendees are responsible for paying or raising from $10, 000 to $50, 000. The second event is a reception at the home of art deal Paul Gray and his spouse De. Big Democratic donors John Atkinson and Grace   are also hosting along with Lilli Scheye, Jane and Bob Clark, and Steve Cohen, reports the Times. Attending that event runs from $5, 000 to $25, 000. Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump said at a Wednesday afternoon rally in Canton, Ohio, that he had just visited Flint, Michigan himself. “It should never happen in the United States of America,” he said. “This is the catastrophe that does happen when we build up other countries instead of our own. ” “It used to be, cars were made in Flint and you couldn’t drink the water in Mexico. Now the cars are made in Mexico and you can’t drink the water in Flint,” Trump said at the Wednesday rally. Flint’s Democratic mayor Karen Weaver endorsed Clinton over   Sen. Bernie Sanders in January. In March the International Business Times reported that during Clinton’s term as a U. S. Senator from New York, she opposed a bipartisan bill banning a controversial fuel additive, a possible carcinogen, that can seriously contaminate drinking water. The 2005 legislation stated that the compound had been found in U. S. water sources. The IBT report also noted that at the time she voted against the measure she was running for   and raised “more than $74, 000 from the oil and gas industry, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. ” Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana ",0
"A new poll out from the Los Angeles Times shows the race for the Golden State between billionaire Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich tightening. [Among registered GOP voters, Trump leads Cruz and Kasich with 37 percent to Cruz’s 30 percent and Kasich’s 12 percent.  “Riding a rebellion fueled by opposition to illegal immigration and pessimism about the nation’s future, Donald Trump leads a scrambling duo of competitors less than three months before California’s Republican presidential primary, a new USC   Angeles Times statewide poll has found,” Cathleen Decker of the Times wrote of the publication’s new poll. The survey, according to cross tabs, asked the presidential preference of 391 registered Republicans from March 16 to March 23 —  producing the 37 to 30 Trump lead over Cruz with Kasich lagging behind at 12 points and with a margin of error of 5. 5 percent. The   lead is slightly smaller than the low double digit leads Trump has enjoyed in previous Golden State polling done in March, albeit by rival firms to the Los Angeles Times and USC Dornsife. One poll had Trump up 11 points over his competitors, while another had him up 16 points. There’s another interesting wrinkle in the polling data, in that the Los Angeles Times and USC Dornsife also narrowed down the sample to “likely voters” in the GOP primary and found an even closer race. That sample size, according to RealClearPolitics, which used that slice of the poll in its polling averages for the California primary rather than the wider registered GOP voters sample, was slightly smaller at 332 likely GOP voters. Decker’s piece briefly addresses this in the copy —  and includes a chart further explaining it —  but the cross tabs data on the poll only includes the results for the wider registered GOP voters sample, and there is no explanation in either place for the discrepancy in the results or how the pollsters determined someone who was a registered GOP voter was “likely” to turn out on June 7. “But among the voters most likely to turn out, the poll shows the race between Trump and Cruz is nearly tied, with Trump at 36% versus Cruz at 35%,” Decker wrote. “The difference illustrates how a low turnout in the June 7 primary could hurt Trump and boost Cruz. ” On the cross tabs page of the polling, the results among the “likely” voters section has no data regarding this different sample set, making the omission even more interesting. The cross tabs released do include the full data on the registered voters question, and break down how Trump gets to 37 percent in that sample, and so on. The last time the Los Angeles Times did a poll of the California GOP presidential primary was back between August 29 and September 8, and that poll was done among registered GOP voters —  and no effort was made to clarify any difference between “registered” and “likely” voters. Back then, Trump was still in front —  but with only 24 percent as compared to 37 percent now —  and Cruz was down at just six percent. Kasich wasn’t even on the map and only achieved two percent in thef California poll last summer. Regardless of which set of numbers one believes in this new poll, neither is good for Trump —  though the latter is bad for the billionaire frontrunner. While he’s still ahead in   California, which awards 172 delegates by congressional district on June 7, a tightening race means a protracted battle with Cruz, with Kasich, and with the GOP establishment hellbent on destroying Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Polls tightening this far away —  more than two months —  from a particular contest is never good for Trump, who has, many times, seen his massive polling leads shrink at least a little bit before contests.",0
"Hillary Clinton’s own State Department legal adviser sent “confidential” and classified information on a private email address. [While Clinton continues to be dogged by revelations that she swapped classified materials on a   private email server and faces an ongoing FBI investigation into her conduct, records reveal that her own legal team was unconcerned with State Department protocols governing the exchange of sensitive foreign policy materials.  In fact, the very legal adviser who counseled Clinton on her private email use was the one who brazenly engaged in the practice. Harold Hongju Koh, a State Department “legal adviser,” sent an email on February 17, 2012, to State Department officials Kimberly Gahan and Mary McLeod discussing a “crisis” in Egypt that led to criminal charges for 19 Americans as part of a series of raids on   organizations (NGO) in the country. Koh also sent the email to his official State Department account. Koh sent it from a   Department account, as evidenced by the fact that the sender’s name was listed as “Harold Koh” and not “Koh, Harold Hongju,” which connotes the use of his official email address. Additionally, Koh’s private email address was redacted in the State Department’s release of the email. Koh later forwarded the   email directly to Clinton from his State Department account. The subject of the email was “PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL. ” The email opened with the line “PRIVILEGED AND        WORK PRODUCT. ” The email was classified by the State Department and other federal entities. The email was marked with Redaction Codes 1. 4 (B) which means that it had “Foreign government information” in it, and also 1. 4 (D) which means that it pertained to “Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources. ” “Classified by DAS,   DoS on     —   Class: CONFIDENTIAL  —   Reason: 1. 4( B) 1. 4( D)  —   Declassify on:  ” the released copy of the email states. “At the invitation of the Egyptian Government, [Redacted] and I went to Cairo from February   2012 to seek a solution to the impasse over NGO activities that has caused nearly two dozen NGO workers to be criminally charged and six Amcits from NDI and IRI to take refuge in Amembassy Cairo,” Koh wrote. Accompanied by Ambassador Anne Patterson, we spent Feb. 15 seeing Foreign Minister Amr (twice) General Muwafi of the Egypt General Intelligence Service (EGIS) (for 3+ hours) Minister of Justice Abdallah and the   personnel at the Embassy as well as their lawyers. Amr and Muwafi earnestly claimed to be eager to resolve the crisis in a way that mitigates the harm to the bilateral strategic relationship between our countries. The email, which includes a major redacted portion, concludes, “We will be in touch with the   lawyers to see whether a hearing has been scheduled on the lifting of the travel ban, and will keep you posted with any new information we may have. ” Koh was responsible for advising Clinton on her email use during their shared tenure at the State Department. “This is   privilege, I can’t answer that question,” Koh told The Guardian in 2015, referring to his work advising Clinton on her server. “You know, what as a lawyer you say to your client  …     I can’t answer that question. ” Clinton is currently under FBI investigation regarding her use of private emails to conduct classified State Department business. Reached for comment, Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said, “That’s not true, and what’s more is I bet you know that. ” Pressed to explain the clear evidence that Koh used a private email address, Merill added, “You’re either not trying or have some serious blinders on. ” Pressed further on the clear evidence, Merrill discontinued our conversation.",0
" In 2014, I wrote an article about New Hampshire’s very swingy congressional districts. With the same Democrat and Republican facing off in the First District for the fourth  —   yes, fourth  —   time, I couldn’t resist another visit. Presidential candidate after presidential candidate visits this city, the biggest in New Hampshire. In late January or early February, its strip malls and   main drag can feel like the center of the political world, as the news media descends and the voters decide whom they will rocket to the center of the presidential race with their     primary. It has also become part of a more predictable biennial battle: The tug of war between Representative Frank C. Guinta, a Republican, and former Representative Carol   a Democrat, over the congressional seat that one of them has held for a decade. Watching them debate is “like seeing an old married couple rehash the same argument year after year after year,” said Andy Smith, the director of the Survey Center at the University of New Hampshire. No one wants to see that anymore, he said. The extended nature of this particular matchup is due in large part to the dynamics of the district  —   and to the tenacity of two party outsiders who see, in alternating elections, a path to victory. New Hampshire’s First District is one of a shrinking number of swing districts, with a large number of independent voters and perhaps a slightly Republican tilt. Ms.   first elected when she was a   social worker, has done better during presidential election years, and Mr. Guinta in midterm elections. It is hard to keep the seat  —   but also hard to suffer a resounding defeat. Ms.   first won the seat, which had previously been controlled by Republicans for decades, in 2006, amid a swell of antiwar sentiment that helped Democrats around the country. She held on to it in 2008, when President Obama was elected, but lost it to Mr. Guinta, a former mayor of Manchester, in the Tea Party wave of 2010. Ms.   recaptured it as Mr. Obama won   in 2012, but lost it, again to Mr. Guinta, in 2014. This time around, polling shows Ms.   with a clear advantage. A WMUR Granite State poll released this month showed her with 43 percent support among likely voters, and Mr. Guinta with 29 percent. Voters are “probably sick and tired of these two candidates running against each other,” said David Wasserman, the House editor of The Cook Political Report. “The race essentially becomes a function of turnout as a result. ” Both candidates have overcome skepticism within their parties to return to the fray this year. Some of New Hampshire’s top Republicans, including Senator Kelly Ayotte, suggested last year that Mr. Guinta should resign after he settled a campaign finance violation, but he slipped through the primary after embracing Donald J. Trump. Hacked emails from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reviewed by The Portsmouth Herald showed party leaders trying to encourage someone to challenge Ms.   in a primary, but he did not enter the race. “These two, in particular, are so stubborn,” Mr. Wasserman said, “that I’ll be surprised when they stop running against each other. ” For the candidates, it is like seeing disliked neighbors emerge from their house once every two years, and wishing that they would just move away. “I wish I weren’t running against the same person, but he did win his primary, so here we go again,” Ms.   said. Said Mr. Guinta, “She does tend to talk about almost identical issues that she’s campaigned on in previous campaigns. ” There are also   candidates, including Shawn O’Connor, who is running as an independent. He, along with Mr. Guinta and Ms.   spoke at a congressional forum here this month. “That was kind of nice to hear someone else for a change,” said Christine Williams, a college admissions director and a Republican.",0
"The sale of a major league sports team always draws attention and local interest. But this one may attract even more interest, especially around the White House. The Kushners, the New York real estate family whose scion is a close adviser to President Trump, are in negotiations to buy the Miami Marlins baseball team, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The Kushners  —   led by Joshua Kushner, a venture capitalist, and Joseph Meyer, his    and key lieutenant for the family’s investments  —   have pursued the Marlins for several months, devising a complicated financial arrangement that would include bringing in partners later, these people said. Mr. Kushner is the younger brother of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s   . Neither Jared Kushner, who married Ivanka Trump in 2009 and is a top White House adviser, nor Charles Kushner, the family patriarch who spent over a year in prison for illegal campaign donations, tax evasion and witness tampering, is participating in the effort, these people said. Yet it was unclear whether a deal would be reached, or whether the family would prevail in any bidding contest. Forbes reported on Thursday that the team had a “handshake agreement” to sell the team for about $1. 6 billion, a figure that the people involved in the process said the Kushner family has contended was too high and refused to pay. Any deal would have to win the approval of Major League Baseball, which would closely scrutinize the buyer’s financing and would probably seek to ensure that Charles Kushner had no role in operations. The deal has already prompted questions within Major League Baseball, according to the people briefed on the conversations, about what kind of relationship Mr. Trump would have to the team and whether that would be a benefit or a disadvantage. Would fans or sponsors boycott or embrace the team or league based on a comment or Twitter post by Mr. Trump? And would Mr. Trump attend games? While Jared Kushner has not been not involved in the bidding for the Marlins  —   and he has pledged to be   from any of the family’s businesses  —   he and his brother had bid for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012, though they eventually withdrew from the bidding. The winner was a group backed by the financial firm Guggenheim Partners, which paid over $2 billion. As part of the financing for the Kushners’ bid, which was being shepherded by the boutique investment bank LionTree, the family would plan to bring in additional partners to help defray the costs. Representatives for the Kushners, the Marlins and LionTree declined to comment. Some of the people with knowledge of the Kushners’ bid said that Joshua Kushner, drawing upon his experience investing in technology companies like Instagram, saw potential profits in capitalizing on the Marlins’ digital rights. The Marlins are currently owned by Jeffrey Loria, who paid $158 million for the team in 2002 after selling the Montreal Expos back to Major League Baseball. The team won the World Series in 2003  —   when they defeated the Yankees  —   but has not returned to the playoffs since. Still, Mr. Loria persuaded   County to sell bonds to finance the construction of a new $639 million stadium. Critics of the agreement argued that the bond sale could eventually cost Miami taxpayers more than $1 billion. And there is one other potential wrinkle that might weigh on Mr. Loria: having to pay a percentage of any sale’s profits back to the county. As part of the Marlins’ agreement with the county, Mr. Loria would owe   money if he sold the team within 11 years of signing the 2009 stadium agreement. According to The Miami Herald, the payment would be based on the team’s 2009 valuation of about $250 million it has risen since then.",0
