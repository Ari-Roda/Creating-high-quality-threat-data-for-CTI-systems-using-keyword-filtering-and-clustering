"I've been working on a program to help during a pen test. It is fairly heavy on the enumeration side, but it will do other things like reporting what commands it ran, setting up a pen testing environment, check lists to go through, saving your efforts into a 'session', running many tools within the program in a wizard like interface, etc. I went a head and released it on git hub last night if anyone is interested.

"Hello Redditors!

&#x200B;

When you want to write Linux shellcode (assuming Intel x86, 32bit for this post) you often need to know what system calls and system call numbers you have to use. For example, if you want to exit a program with return code 42 you need the system call number for exit, which is 1:

`mov eax, 1   ; setting the system call number for exit()`

`mov ebx, 42  : exit code`

`int 0x80     ; interrupt to execute the system call`

Normally, I would google ""system calls linux 32bit exit"" and get one or two pages that are kind of useful. But who wants to google all the time? That's why I built a little script that allows you to query system call names and get the system call number as a result. You can find it here along with the documentation: [https://github.com/martinclauss/syscall\_number](https://github.com/martinclauss/syscall_number)

"Our team is starting a [cyber security podcast](https://cisoshare.com/podcast-prelaunch/) — the theme that we're going for is exploring and talking about the truth in topics that most people just don't talk about.

In case you don't want to read the whole landing page: Mike (our president and CEO) has seen a lot of things in security that he wants to address, good and bad.

The first episode we recorded jumps into a brief history of different trends and things in cyber security that he's seen change over the years he's been in the industry, and then he gives a few tips on how to make the most of that trend.

**We wanted to know:** Are there any topics that people want to hear us talk about? Like: Is GRC dead? Why and when does security matter during innovation? Why do people keep making the same mistakes during board presentations?

(If you have opinions on any of those topics, we'd love to hear about those as well!)",1
"Hi, I'm 17 years old and I need help starting out with hacking (ethical hacking). My dad's a cyber security expert (a hacker pretty much), and he dedicates most of his time to his job. I've always been interested in that but I never actually tried getting into it because I was too busy with school and other occupations. I ordered this book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hacking-Ethical-Hackers-Handbook-Fourth/dp/0071832386 about gray hat hacking fundamentals, but I'm not quite sure if that's really a good starting point. I'd like to start off with the basics, and I have all summer to learn so I don't mind something long, that would even better. To give you an idea of my level, the closest thing I've ever done to hacking or coding is learning the fundamentals of javascript, CSS, and HTML when I was bored so I don't know anything about hacking. Can anyone indicate me a good website or book that'd be a good starting point for me?",1

On the eligibility application, there is a section that reads as follows:

“and a scanned copy of an identification document, such as Employee i-Card of your current or previous employment, which does not carry any Personally Identifiable Information. EC-Council strongly discourage you from submitting your passport, driver's license, government ID or any other identification document that carries Personally Identifiable Information.”

But there is no list of what EC-Council considers PII, and no example besides an “Employee i-Card”. This stipulation seems to contradict itself, as any reasonable proof of identity will include at least some “Personally Identifiable Information”. I do not want to pay a non-refundable $100 only to be rejected for such a technicality.

What PII does EC-Council consider as disqualifying?

"I am curious how others handle mitigating social engineering attacks utilizing gotomeeting and various other screen sharing / potential control giving applications?

We blocked gotomeeting's traffic on the firewall for all computers, then put a remotedesktop app on our DMZ for a version of Chrome with GtM installed so that people who need to do GotoMeeting / Webinar utilize the ""GotoMeeting Chrome"".  That way should anyone ever be offered a gotomeeting link they have to go through a server that has restricted access to the network.

We are getting push back in that launching a separate browser is too tedious.

Which has me here asking how do you guys handle it, and are you some how able to restrict GotoMeeting while allowing GotoWebinar to still flow fine?

I'm not trying to prevent Webinars just remote control of machines.  I don't see anything GPO wise I can set to tell Citrix to not allow sharing, just viewing.

"Hello everyone,

I'm a software developer (Rails (Backend), Go, C#) with a large interest in penetration testing and forensics. I've read lots of infosec literature and done a few Challenges (HTB and SecGen VMs mostly), but I'm lacking experience with real pentests. I don't like leaving my current employer, so bug bounties would be a side business for me. 

I'm quite scared of trying to get a bug bounty and going in for the ""kill"" because I've heard quite a few horror stories of pentesters getting sued or arrested when claiming a bug bounty... 

Have any of you had the same experience? How did your first few shots for a bug bounty go - both your epic successes and your blunders? I've had many of the latter and definitely a lot of what felt like the former. And... have any of you ever had a conflict with the law or someone who wanted to get out of paying a bounty? How did it end?

"Hey guys,

I'm new on here and signed up after seeing plenty of you asking questions about the value of the OSCP and other certs. 

I've been working with some of the market leading security consultancies and recruiting for penetration testers over the past few years and I'm keen to pass on my advice of how the OSCP adds value.

Whenever anyone asks me if the cert adds value, I say absolutely yes! To the extent that some of the key players in the market don't even look at a CV if the candidate has not passed the OSCP or CRT. 

The reason reputable certifications are so sought after by employers in this space is that they use them as proof of quality when they sell a consultants services into a client. 

The CRT is more credible than the OSCP in the UK but across Europe the OSCP is far more recognized. 

For all of you deliberating on whether it is worth it or not, it absolutely is so go for it!!

Good luck :-)",1
"Last week, our garage door stopped working.  First, we thought it was the controller(s)--replaced batteries etc, then we thought it was something physical, logic board etc.  We noticed when we got closer (within feet) the door would open.  So, we figured it was some kind of interference.  We made plans to turn off all our circuits etc 'tomorrow'.  Than the night before, I heard a faint noise...  our Verizon Fios backup battery was sounding an alert.  The backup battery needed replacing. We immediately knew...this could be it...so we bypassed the backup battery and tested our controllers with the garage door--and it works again!   Fortunately, we did not get frustrated.  It was not super important to fix it, etc.  It was nice to stumble across the cause .  It definitely demonstrates how something can interfere with another frequency and is a good example or story to share when someone asks for examples of DoS.",1

with multiple people in the comments confirming it works and also reporting their accounts were stolen.

Here's how it works:

1. Sign up for a new Skype account. Use the victim's email. A warning will come up that an account with that email already exists, but you can still proceed with filling out the form and account creation.

2. Log in to the Skype client with your new account.

3. https://login.skype.com/account/password-reset-request - request a password reset using the victim's email.

4. You will get a password reset notification and token in your skype client. Follow the link to pick the victim's account and reset the password.

not publicly known.

"As the title says, I passed this morning!  I’m so relieved that it’s over.  I almost cried as soon as I got the results.

How I prepared:  

Six months of off and on study that included reading the Sybex book (do not recommend, I’d rather watch paint dry), Kelly Handerhan videos and the Boson tests.  

One month ago I started reading the Sybex for several hours every night and drilling with Boson tests.  I went through a boot camp this week with Training Camp (Highly Recommend) and did nothing but study at night.  Training Camp provided a copy of the ISC2 practice questions book too, which was also very helpful. 

If you have the ISC2 practice question book, register it for the online Wiley tests.  It’s much easier to review and mimics a real test environment.  

Huge thank you to all those that came before me, you’re the ones who helped me find the right resources and motivation.  

Now I’m off to take a nap!!",1
"Hi everyone,

In order to start the ""Penetration Testing Training with Kali Linux"" it says that you need to have a ""Reasonable understanding of Linux"", which I absolutely know nothing about....So my **2 questions** are:  


  
**1-** Should I lean Linux, let's say through the Linux Foundation (they recommand 6hrs per week for 8weeks), or its more than just ""reasonable"" & I might be learning lots of things I will learn through the PWK course?  


**2-** It's (Linux foundation class) asking me to ""to have at least one Linux distribution installed""... Should I use Kali Linux or another distro? - Sorry I'm totally new to this.

On their site it says:

The families and representative distributions we are using are: 

* **Red Hat Family Systems** (including CentOS and Fedora)
* **SUSE Family Systems** (including openSUSE)
* **Debian Family Systems** (including Ubuntu and Linux Mint).

"I took 60 days lab first and my first attempt was 25 point. Only Bof question. In the first exam I try to exploit everything I found and spent my all time in rabbit holes. 

I took 1 month lab extension and exam.  In my second exam I make a list everything I found and I used google more effectively, read every possible exploit and vulnerabilities first and after that I tried to exploit things. Guides helped me a lot and topics in here. I wrote in reddit something like if you are finding yourself writing an exploit from zero, you are probably in a rabbit hole.  After my first exam this made me realise that I am doing wrong.

"My question originates from following articles: 

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/14/cloudflare_investigating_mystery_interception_of_site_traffic_across_india/

I wanted to understand how does ISP intercept web traffic? Do they block DNS request? However, this can be circumvented with using different DNS servers. OR Do they block http get requests? I have no knowledge of traffic interception, however; I feel this is the most plausible method.

My reason for stating the above is because whenever I try to visit a website blocked (or redirected to a block page) by my ISP it is usually a http request. If I add https in the URL the website appears and I have access to it.

For example: http://websitename.com – blocked
https://websitename.com – full access.

"Sat a couple hours ago, and passed at an odd point.

Resources -
Sybex 8th Ed - annoying, but read through fully once taking notes (2 notebooks worth). Couple reviews of individual sections.

Boson question simulator - good for identifying sections to focus on, far more technical than the real thing.

Sunflower - only resource used last week or so, just went through and jotted notes on things I didn't have down pat.

Handerhan videos - too slow for me, and no autoplay made me bail from this. The Why you will pass was great though. 


Exam itself -

Brutal, far more questions on processes and much greater detail on them than I expected. Know your DR/BCP/SDLC steps and meanings pat. Nearly every question was interpretative - 'Best technical option' or 'effective option'. Definetly remember this is about policies and processes first and foremost.

"Hello guys,

I am currently studying for CEH exam and I am in a bit of dilemma:

First of all the reason I am taking CEH is not only professional goals but I also want to learn cybersecurity domain in general. I currently don't work in IT security however I do work with Information Systems and Information Technologies to various extent. So my goal is not only to pass the CEH but to actually gain knowledge and understanding. 

I recently started AIO 3rd Ed. and I must say it is a great book for studying but when compared to modules presented by EC-Council it feels like AIO doesn't go as much in depth and just outlines useful information for exam. I also like EC council labs.

"Hi all

I'm starting my OSCP labs soon, and I would like some opinions on whether VMware or Virtualbox is the better option for the OSCP Kali image.  I have used Kali on Virtualbox quite a bit in the past and it has for the most part been functional.  There are several times that I have had trouble the VM randomly being corrupted and required multiple snapshot rollbacks or in most cases it was just easier to blow the VM away and start over.  I talked to a few other people and they said that they have had much better luck running Kali in VMware.  Is this true?  Is VMWare Workstation Pro more stable that Kali?  It definitely seems to have a better feature set, but I'm not seeing anything so far that would warrant the $249.00 over Kali.  I am not paying for it, so the money is not a problem.  I was just curious if there was a preference within the OSCP student community as to one or the other.

Any info would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.",1
"I’ve noticed recently there are soooo many passes. Which is great! As a CISSP’er myself I love seeing the security world thrive, especially with an obscurely written and TOUGH exam like this. One where I’d rather nail my nuts to a wooden post than to ever study for this thing again. 

Having said that though, I’m curious why there aren’t people posting failures on here? Or is everyone just passing? 

My fear is people are afraid to post a failure. Don’t ever be ashamed of a failure. When I was studying, I sometimes learned more from people posting their failures than I did from people posting their passes. 

So don’t be ashamed, post them, tell people what worked, what didn’t work, learn from your failures and find motivation from it!

I'm just wondering how you guys keep your skills sharp, especially as you get families and as you get older. The technology changes very rapidly and the threats are constantly changing.
While some security professionals operate from 9-5, the threats are coming from people who easily spend 12+ hours a day in front of keyboard on top the 24x7 scripts they run.
Naturally, the hard technical types are young 20 - 30ish professionals who are without family. The work is never done. While there are people who are truly passionate about the profession and can dedicate endless hours upon hours to the cause, I want to spend more time with my family now.
I suppose the fundamentals will never change. Those, will never be relinquished after years of hard work, but other skills if I do not practice, will fade with time. Maybe we all have our own choices to make, and maybe at this point, I've chosen my family over keeping my technical edge.",1

"Hello, recently I was planning to go to college but decided against it because I basically have nothing going for me. Family makes too much money, bad grade, white, male. In short I can't get any scholarships, so its going to cost a lot. Then theres the problem with me being years behind in math, I am not sure I will be able to pass college which is just more risk on my end, its like betting $12k if you can pass a semester or not. One of my buddies told me about the Air force having a cyber division and I thought maybe that would be a way I could get myself into this field without going $60k in debt. But then I thought, there has to be a catch to this. If you can save the price of a new SUV by going to the military, why wouldn't everyone do it? It would be common sense.

"I posted this over at [r/Korean](http://www.reddit.com/r/korean) and [r/LearnJapanese](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjapanese) and someone suggested I should post it here too.

I made a video describing the method I use to memorize Korean vocabulary, but it can be applied to any language. I've used this method for a long time, for several different languages, and it's worked great. With a few sheets of paper and 30-45 minutes, you can learn at least 50 new vocabulary words per day. Once you get used to the system, it's expandable safely up to 100 (but don't try that much unless you need to).

Here's the **[link to the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5A71i4EZ_w)**.

"So last weekend I got some LSD that was pretty weak. Two tabs gave me just above threshold effects, and I only have 2 tabs left. However I do have a nootropic stack with me which I am thinking of combining it with. This stack is ready mixed and consists of equal portions of the following (I already know the stack is not ideal in terms of the dosage of each of them being equal)


1.Piracetam


2.Aniracetam 


3.L-Tyrosine 


4.Sulbutiamine  


5.L-phenylalanine 


6.Choline Bitartrate 


7.Alpha GPC Alpha 


8.DMAE


9.GABA 


10.L-Leucine

So I have a few questions about this combination. 

Firstly is their any danger in combining the LSD with this stack?


Secondly any interactions? I am aware that Piracetam and Aniracetam will make it stronger (I'm counting on it) but how will the others affect it.


Thirdly, If the answers to the above are positive, How much should I take before taking the Acid?

"I am personally excited about having a heavily moderated subreddit as part of the defaults (I'm not sure but /r/books might qualify here as well) so that new users, and even users that don't have accounts, will see that some reddits have rules.

The other interesting thing, to me, about having /r/earthporn as a default is that it links very prominently to other subs in the SFW porn network giving a lot of subs visibility. I think that I went to reddit.com and just looked at the default front page for a few months before I even started to notice there were subreddits. The big reason I made an account was so I could subscribe to smaller subs.

Finally, I know there are some reservations about the ""porn"" part of the /r/Earthporn sub name but I'm mostly interested in how new users will be impacted by a sub that they can obviously not post just anything to (whereas subs like /r/pics, /r/funny and /r/wtf obviously don't have many rules).",0

"When you're reheating leftovers such as fried foods, breads, pizza, or anything else that has the tendency to become soggy or chewy, use the broiler in your oven. This technique helps retain original flavor and moisture. 

Turn on your broiler. The level (low, med, high) will depend on a few factors: type and size of food, how quickly you want to eat, and current temperature of the food.

Cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and lay out your spread. 

Determine the best rung for the rack by considering these factors: shape and size of your food and how close you want it to the heating elements. Placing food close under the heating elements will offer up excellent crispy results. Great for fries, wings, pizza, and the like. 

Leave your oven door slightly ajar or the intense heat of the broiler will cause your food to burn before you can say, ""oh shit!""

Check often and give the food a chance to cool slightly. Plate it up and enjoy!

"So basically i've had acne since high school (i'm now in college). It has never been horrible but i've always been a little self conscious of it. It's always been primarily white heads and red bumps with pus inside on my face, mainly my chin. Lately i've decided to change up my diet and see if it has any effect. I'm greatly reducing high GI foods and dairy. 

My issue is that I really don't want to cut out dairy since i'm trying to gain weight and milk and protein are super useful. I've always drank milk but in the last year i've at least tripled my milk drinking. After increasing milk ingestion, though, my acne did not really get worse, it pretty much stayed the same. I would think that if dairy were a primary cause, increased milk intake would make me break out much worse. My question is:

To which I replied ""Yeah, but America is pretty backwards in that, many developed countries have had women leaders. The prime minister of Germany is a lesbian."" (I was wrong, though it was Iceland. But the point was the same.)

His response just flabbergasted me, I was without words. He just said ""Well then she isn't really a woman.""

"I have been following DayZ for many months..enjoying the screenshots, youtube vids, forum banter and fantasizing about it. This is the game I have dream of for about the last ~15 years or so.

I have yet to purchase it due to a myriad of factors but will do so the minute the Stand Alone version is available.

I was just curious how many other DayZ lurkers are out there like myself who have yet to play it and are awating the SA to finally jump in.

**Update**: Glad to see I am not the only one ;). I will add that seeing Rocket's posts (reddit/forums/blog/twitter) take me back to the days when I used to be so excited to see John Carmack's (and other id software employees) .plan updates to get smidgens of news regarding their latest games. 

This game is bringing me back into PC gaming. I had pretty much quit all together 4-5 years ago but will now be jumping back into it thanks to Rocket. Thank you and keep up the great work!",0

"Well, I really love this game and it does a lot of things well. One major issue I find though, it the minimap. I really wish instead of just dots, you could see who each dot represents. Another thing is since we can't move our screen independently of our characters, I often find myself seeing a bunch of dots jumping around so I dive in, only to find my two teammates are at about 3 hp, or are dead right as I arrive and find myself in a 1v3. Not knowing how the game is made, I can't really determine if making it so the dots were instead mini naught icons would be difficult. But having a bar on the side with teammate health bars would be massively helpful, or anything really indicating your teammates status would be great. I guess the game just feel too blind at points.

Just throwing the idea out there to see if anyone agrees. I think it would be a welcome addiction an encourage more people to pay attention to the minimap.",0
"I follow people who's tweets I'd like to read, so I try to read them.

Because I follow just 100 accounts, I can read everything that's on my timeline if I check every couple of hours. There's lots of links posted too, so reading takes more time than just scrolling through my timeline.

Now, many people follow several hundreds of accounts, including news accounts tweeting once every couple of minutes. How do they use Twitter? Scroll through their timeline extremely fast? Only read what's posted just now? Wouldn't that be pointless, since if someone tweets interesting stuff at a time when you can't check Twitter, you'll miss that content.

tl;dr: People post cool stuff even when you're not checking Twitter. I can't stand missing these updates.

Edit: what makes it difficult is that I'm in Europe, but many accounts I follow are from America, so I'll miss a lot of that if I don't read tweets posted while I was asleep.",0
"It's strange.  Every day I see something that I've known for years because of linguistics, but that everyday people seem to be completely unaware of.  The pin/pen merger was on there today.  I think I also saw something about Deaf babies learning language at the same rate as hearing kids (*ahem*, DUH?).  Otherwise it's something about German having been a common language in the USA years ago or y'all and you guys, etc, etc, etc.  

Frankly, I'm just really surprised by the quantity of ling-related things you find on there on a regular basis (far out-weighting for example Chemistry or Math, or probably even Anthropology for that matter.)

Anyways, I just found it amusing and was interested to hear your thoughts.  Maybe we can get a Karma-Machine going here? haha.

"Ok so please help me out here kind atheists of reddit. I see many a critique of people who do not believe the theory of evolution because they say it is just that, a theory. The common rebuttal is often that a theory is still a fact, much like the theory of gravity is a scientific fact. However, I keep finding many credible sources that refer to gravity as ""The Law of Gravity"", not ""The Theory of Gravity."" If that's the case, this is a common arguable fallacy that cannot be used to debate a creationists point. From my understanding, scientists us hypothesis to come up with the idea of how nature works, then by proven tests produce a scientific theory, and finally a nearly indisputable scientific law is established. Therefore this common fallacy of calling a creationist ignorant for not believing in evolution but believing in gravity really bothers me. 

Am I missing something about scientific law vs theory?

"It'd be an app for your phone with a simple ""on/off"" icon for your homescreen.  
Whenever you had a boner, you would turn it on. When it retreated, switch back to off.  
Basically, the app would use your phone's GPS to place the location of you and your boner on a world/local map. You'd be able to see how many people in the world currently have boners.  
You'd also be able to see large clusters of boners in your area and be like ""whoa...I better get down there. Something's going on that's giving everyone a boner"".  
Facebook/Twitter integration would be a must.  
You could track friends' boners so you could shoot them a text like ""congrats on the boner"" and collect stats for yourself and others, e.g. boner frequency, boner duration, prime boner time.  
You'd probably also want bluetooth or NFC to alert you of boners within 100ft of you so you know to knock before walking in a room and getting an eyeful of boner.

"Any EU redditors surfing r/truetf2? If not i'm sorry for the post. 

**Here is the spreadsheet for s9:** [link](http://ugc.tf2itemtrader.com/stats.htm)

Couple of points: 

 * # Logs only show quantitative features, not qualitative (big plays etc)

 * # Total amount of kills or dmg is pretty meaningless because players have different playtimes or missing logs, also many matches lasts longer than others. So stats like damage per minute or KA/D will be more useful.

 * # The spreadsheet is a work in progress and should be more aesthetically pleasing and user friendly in the future. What’s important now is that the data is all accurate as far as the original data goes.

"A few months ago, I started the process of getting a medical waiver for my recent (June 2012) herniated lumbar disc and the subsequent surgery needed to fix it.  I have no idea how the injury occurred, except that symptoms presented themselves when training with the ROTC at Ft. Knox.

I was told by my doctors that it was unlikely that I would regain all of my strength/feeling, but it's been 7 months (+ 1 day) since surgery and I've never been in better shape.  Today, my recruiter called to tell me that they approved my waiver and I get to go [back] to MEPS next week.  I never thought I'd be saying this, but I'm actually excited to be going back to MEPS and getting this nightmare behind me.

"I have a windows based laptop that throughout the day needs to connect to a number of different wireless networks.  The problem is that on many of these networks I need to have a static IP address, and this address is different depending on the network connected to.
Currently I am going in and changing the IP, gateway, etc... every time I change networks.  While this is not hard to do it can be a pain, especially when sometimes testing network changes can result in bouncing around networks every few minutes.

Does anyone know of a way to tie certain address settings to specific wireless networks in windows xp via SSID or BSSID of the AP?  As an example, I want my machine to have an address of 10.0.18.98 when connected to network xyz, but as soon as I change to network abc have the address change to 192.168.14.143.

"Context: I am a very lucid dreamer. I know every dream I have is, well, a dream. I remember most of them from start to end and when going to sleep I can actually consciously experience the transition between awake and REM.

Well, I also have something I consider a trigger. For example, I will be very tired but not willing to fall asleep or just not able to. The only time I fall asleep is after I hear what I consider my alpha waves turning into beta waves. I can literally hear the frequencies. In a sense that I don't know I am ready to sleep until I hear them. Soon as I hear them I know I can no longer fight staying awake, soon as they trigger it's bed time no matter how hard I fight it. My brain is set on sleepy time and has put the gears in motion. I can slap myself a bit to stay awake, but it'll happen again within minutes.

Furthermore, I'd like to improve the professionalism of my code as I might like to contribute to some open source projects in the future and don't want my contributions to look n00bish.

I took this sub over from its creator who originally intended it to be a tobacco smoking sub.  And i did so because I wanted to have a place to specifically discuss smoking foods.  And I'm glad that I found a bunch of like minded folks who want the same.

"One thing that puzzles me is Kubo's depiction of Unohana's bankai. He usually takes the trouble to explain, over several chapters, people's bankais and leaves nothing out. 

In this case, however, Minazuki's bankai has nothing except torrents of acid/illusion(?) blood going for it. And then we have Unohana saying [''My entire legacy I leave in your hands''](http://mangafox.me/manga/bleach/v58/c527/10.html) to Kenpachi, and in the background we see her letting go of Minazuki.

The question is this: Is her letting go of her zanpaktou symbolic of her letting go of the title, or does she actually mean ''Here, have Minazuki and wield it and show all the fans the power of its bankai''? 

It's also interesting that Kenny's zanpaktou woke up at that *specific* moment.

Also, maybe only a true Kenpachi is allowed to wield Minazuki, and the the literal transfer is what makes the next person a Kenpachi?

"Alright first off I understand the simple answer is eat more, but I have other questions.  1 month ago I changed my diet so I was eating 3.5k calories a day(I saw on the stronglifts site a 3.5k diet for guys that wanted to be 180lbs like me). I'm 6'3"" 165lbs and have decently low body fat(six pack without flexing). I keep track of my calories using myfitnesspal and I bought a cheap food scale. A month later and I'm maybe 3lbs heavier.  So here's my questions.

1) What should my macros look like? Right now I hover around 40% carbs, 40% fat, and 20% protein.  I make sure I get over 1g/lb everyday(usually around 180).  

2) Is it too soon to see any gains?  I have read about people gaining 10lbs in a month but I'm not sure if that is normal or not.  3lbs in a month seems pretty tiny though.

3) Should I bump it up to 4k calories?  3.5k seems pretty difficult but I need to gain weight sometime ha.

"Hi all, I was looking at various outdoor/bushcraft knives, and I had a question about the blades.

The knife I currently use (buck 119) has sort of two tapers on the blade (I don't know if there is any sort of terminology for that).  By that I mean, it tapers from the middle of the blade, and then there's another taper to the edge.

I've been looking at some bushcraft blades, though, and it seems like there is only one taper from the middle of the blade to the edge.

Here's an example: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8291/7806122906_7f2251ab6d_b.jpg

My questions are: 1) do they actually have blades like the latter? or am I just seeing it wrong?
2) is one type of blade better than the other?  Is the blade with only one taper easier to sharpen or anything?  (I've sharpened my buck knife, but have never gotten it razor sharp)
3) What is the purpose of either type of blade?

thanks!

"First of all, I am no professional DJ by any means.  I have a nice setup (Pioneer DDJ-S1) and a couple of speakers.  I pretty much mess around every so often on them in my free time.  I can do basic mixing and looping.  However, my music selection might not be the best fit for a party/dancing atmosphere as some of my music is probably more esoteric to the average joe.  Basically I need some music that people can recognize and dance to on the floor.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  And if you could recommend any good music pools or sites to download from, that would also be amazing.  I love hearing unique mashups and I feel it gives a lot of flare for a set.  Also, any general DJ knowledge you cna share would be very helpful.",0

only enabled me to skip taking a literature class at The University of

"Just got a physical for the first time in many years and after a blood test, I came up deficient in vitamin D. He's already prescribed me the D3 supplements, but what worries me is I get 6-8 hours of nonstop sunlight a day, 5-6 days a week from working outside. I'm fair skinned which means I generally absorb vitamin D much faster than someone with dark skin. I've had blood tests in the past, and I've had no problems with this before. I've checked WebMD (I know...), and I do not suffer from any allergies, get more than the recommended amount of sunlight, and eat plenty of meat, so I'm struggling to understand why I would have a deficiency in the first place. I've read the other posts, and most just said ""take the supplements and get more sun"". Since I already do one, and will be getting the supplements tomorrow, my only other concern is why my body is not absorbing/creating Vitamin D from the 6-8 hours of sunlight I get a day.",0
"So I posted here a while ago as I'd never had an orgasm before, I got a lot of good advice (thank you!) and am still practicing! I went to talk to my GP about it and she said as I'm still young (22) there is still hope! and to just pretty much buy up the entirety of Ann Summers (British sex toy retailer) and try different things to see what works for me, she gave me a card for a sex clinic as well but I'm still trying different toys at home, I've done some research into people with the same difficulties as me and came across this Hitachi Magic Wand that apparently has magical powers. Out of a group of 465 chronic anorgasmic women, 93% of them could apparently then reach orgasm using the Hitachi wand!
 I'll probably buy it anyway when I can afford it, but I wanted to ask you guys, have any or you used it? Is it as good as it claims? Anyone been in a similar position to me that's used it?
 I'd love to know what you guys think! ",0
